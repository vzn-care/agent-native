# @agent-native/dispatch

## 0.12.2

### Patch Changes

- c294aaa: Expand localized UI coverage across core client surfaces, Dispatch chrome, scheduling controls, templates, and the docs site.

## 0.12.1

### Patch Changes

- 6067f27: Fix right-to-left (`ar-SA`) layout in shared framework chrome. Physical directional CSS in the agent panel, command menu, language picker, shadcn `ui/*` primitives, settings/composer/org/sharing/onboarding panels, and the agent-conversation/blocks/rich-markdown styles is converted to logical utilities (`ms`/`me`, `ps`/`pe`, `start`/`end`, `text-start`/`text-end`, `border-s`/`border-e`), and directional icons are mirrored with `rtl:-scale-x-100`. No change to left-to-right rendering (logical utilities are identical to physical in LTR).

## 0.12.0

### Minor Changes

- 16356c2: Add a framework helper for opening the agent settings tab and standardize app settings access in Dispatch.

### Patch Changes

- 16356c2: Add framework localization support with shared i18n providers, locale preference actions, catalog loading helpers, guards, and docs.

## 0.11.9

### Patch Changes

- 4a0d3c4: Clarify Builder code-change handoff fallbacks when cloud agents are unavailable.

## 0.11.8

### Patch Changes

- d684bbf: Keep Dispatch full-page chat thread links type-safe while preserving deep-link handoff behavior.

## 0.11.7

### Patch Changes

- 6605885: Add opt-in URL sync for durable chat threads and route chat-first templates (chat, assets, and Dispatch) through `/chat/:threadId` deep links.

## 0.11.6

### Patch Changes

- 9a984f2: Add a framework audit log: a durable, complete, access-scoped, append-only record of who mutated what app data, when, from where, and — when it was the agent — in which run. Capture is automatic at the `defineAction` seam (default-on for mutating actions; read-only actions opt in via `audit.onRead`), with credential redaction, agent-vs-human actor attribution, and agent thread/turn linkage. Reads go through two new core actions every app inherits — `list-audit-events` and `get-audit-event` — scoped in SQL to the caller's identity and org. Stored in `agent_audit_log` (provider-agnostic), with a retention purge configurable via `AGENT_NATIVE_AUDIT_RETENTION_DAYS` (default 365) and a global kill switch `AGENT_NATIVE_AUDIT_ENABLED=false`. Distinct from observability (sampled telemetry) and tracking (fire-and-forget analytics).

## 0.11.5

### Patch Changes

- d9e93a3: Improve Dispatch default route SEO and social metadata titles.

## 0.11.4

### Patch Changes

- 7157583: Wire Dispatch's full-page chat into the shared chat handoff flow so it can morph into the agent sidebar while preserving the active thread.
- 7157583: Remove the broad shadow from Dispatch's centered chat composer.

## 0.11.3

### Patch Changes

- 8a74b0a: Add the Chat template as the public minimal app on-ramp and keep Starter as a legacy CLI alias.
- 8a74b0a: Add Dispatch automation status controls backed by jobs markdown resources.

## 0.11.2

### Patch Changes

- ca3efcf: Add the Chat template as the public minimal app on-ramp and keep Starter as a legacy CLI alias.
- ca3efcf: Add Dispatch automation status controls backed by jobs markdown resources.

## 0.11.1

### Patch Changes

- f16980e: Expose agent-chat plugin options for skipping first-turn workspace inventory and sending a compact starter tool catalog that expands from tool-search results.

## 0.11.0

### Minor Changes

- f81e032: Add token-efficient web content fetching for agents. `web-request` and `provider-api-docs` can now return extracted markdown, plain text, metadata, links, or bounded search matches instead of raw HTML, and `run-code` exposes `webRead()` plus pass-through options on `webFetch()` for compact web/document reduction.

## 0.10.4

### Patch Changes

- 1d0f069: Add staged provider API responses for Dispatch so broad provider searches can save bounded corpora and reduce them outside chat context.
- 8726f38: Teach all app agents that provider shortcut actions are not capability limits and that broad provider searches, joins, classifications, and absence claims should use provider API staging, saved responses, staged-dataset queries, or sandboxed code with explicit coverage reporting. Ensure lean, A2A, and MCP ask-agent registries include run-code when code execution is enabled, and give sandboxed code generic providerRequest/providerFetchAll helpers for broad paginated provider corpus work.

## 0.10.3

### Patch Changes

- c5abc5c: Fix extension secret setup guidance and hosted Dispatch template scaffolding.

## 0.10.2

### Patch Changes

- 3c1d3eb: Update dispatch provider APIs and scheduling internals for the runtime refresh.

## 0.10.1

### Patch Changes

- 40ed196: Lighten the outline button border in dark mode while keeping the `border-input` token (proper contrast) in light mode.

## 0.10.0

### Minor Changes

- 600f83d: **Custom provider registry** — register any API provider at runtime

  A new `custom_api_providers` SQL table (created on first use, additive) stores
  user/org-scoped provider registrations so the agent can call APIs that are not
  in the 24 built-in PROVIDER_CONFIGS:
  - `upsertCustomProvider`, `deleteCustomProvider`, `listCustomProviders`,
    `getCustomProvider` — CRUD helpers exported from `@agent-native/core/provider-api`.
  - `validateCustomBaseUrl` — SSRF-safe URL validation for registration time.
  - `createProviderApiRuntime` now accepts `getCustomProviders?: () => Promise<CustomProviderConfig[]>`.
    Custom providers are merged into the catalog after built-ins; they cannot
    shadow built-in ids.
  - Auth kinds supported for custom providers: `none`, `bearer`, `basic`,
    `api-key-header`. `google-service-account` and `oauth-bearer` are not
    supported (require out-of-band setup).
  - Credentials live in the existing secrets/credentials store — the provider
    row stores only credential key NAMES, never values.
  - SSRF guard (`isBlockedExtensionUrlWithDns`) is enforced at registration time
    and again at every request.

  **New Dispatch action: `provider-api-register`**

  Register, update, delete, or list custom providers:

  ```
  { operation: "upsert"|"delete"|"list"|"get",
    id, label, baseUrl, auth, docsUrls?,
    allowedHostSuffixes?, defaultHeaders?, notes?, scope? }
  ```

  **Updated Dispatch actions**

  `provider-api-catalog`, `provider-api-docs`, and `provider-api-request` now
  accept any provider id (built-in or custom) — the `provider` field is relaxed
  from `z.enum(BUILT_IN_IDS)` to `z.string()` with runtime validation against the
  merged registry. Unknown provider errors include the list of known provider ids.

  ***

  **Open docs fetching** in `provider-api-docs`

  `fetchProviderApiDocs` now allows ANY public `https`/`http` URL — not just
  URLs same-origin with registered `docsUrls`/`specUrls`. The SSRF guard and
  byte caps still apply. Registered docs/spec URLs remain available as curated
  starting points in the catalog output. The Dispatch `provider-api-docs` action
  description is updated to reflect this.

  ***

  **New `web-search` agent tool** (`packages/core/src/extensions/web-search-tool.ts`)

  Registers a `web-search` tool in dev and prod agent tool registries:
  - Input: `{ query: string, count?: number (default 5, max 10) }`.
  - **Pluggable backends** — at call time the first configured key wins:
    1. `BRAVE_SEARCH_API_KEY` → Brave Search API
    2. `TAVILY_API_KEY` → Tavily
    3. `EXA_API_KEY` → Exa
       Keys are resolved from the per-user/org credentials store first, then env vars.
  - Returns a title / URL / snippet list with guidance to follow up via
    `web-request` or `provider-api-docs`.
  - If no backend is configured, returns a helpful message listing the three keys.
  - Description: "Search the public web — use to find API docs, endpoints, or
    current information, then fetch promising URLs with web-request or
    provider-api-docs."

  **Framework secret registrations** (`register-framework-secrets.ts`)

  `BRAVE_SEARCH_API_KEY`, `TAVILY_API_KEY`, and `EXA_API_KEY` are registered as
  optional workspace-scoped secrets so they surface in the settings UI.

- 600f83d: Add `saveToFile` and `fetchAllPages` to `provider-api-request` and `saveToFile` to `web-request`.
  - `saveToFile?: string` on `provider-api-request` and `web-request`: writes full response
    body to a workspace file path instead of returning it in context. Allows up to 20 MB
    (vs normal 4 MB). Returns compact summary `{ savedToFile, savedTo, status, bytes, contentType, preview }`.
  - `fetchAllPages?: { cursorPath, cursorParam, itemsPath?, maxPages? }` on `provider-api-request`:
    generic cursor pagination — re-issues requests until cursor is empty or maxPages (default 10,
    max 50) is reached; accumulates items from `itemsPath`. Combines naturally with `saveToFile`.
  - `workspace-files` tool added to sandbox bridge default allowlist.

## 0.8.29

### Patch Changes

- 966838d: Expose the Contracts template in public metadata with its dedicated icon alias.

## 0.8.28

### Patch Changes

- d987847: Keep Dispatch route loaders from pulling server-only framework modules into the browser bundle.

## 0.8.27

### Patch Changes

- a56d93d: Remove compiler-verified dead code (unused imports, unused non-exported types,
  and side-effect-free unused locals) across the framework. No behavior or public
  API changes — only declarations the TypeScript compiler proves are unreferenced.
- a56d93d: Fix Messaging enable/disable and webhook setup fetches to use `agentNativePath()`, so they work under a base-path (workspace) mount instead of 404ing at the gateway root.
- a56d93d: Route outbound A2A, Dispatch vault, and scheduling webhook requests through
  SSRF-safe URL fetch paths.

## 0.8.26

### Patch Changes

- 6e6fce7: Internal cleanup sweep: remove unused imports/variables and tidy code (no behavior change).

## 0.8.25

### Patch Changes

- 853ab71: Escape application-state and resource prefix queries so literal `%` and `_` characters do not over-match keys. Also make core store initialization retry after transient failures instead of caching rejected promises, and keep run SSE polling moving past corrupt persisted events.

  Search and rate-limit LIKE filters now treat user text literally, including chat-thread/debug searches and inbound-email sender matching.

## 0.8.24

### Patch Changes

- d4013f0: Remove compiler-verified dead code (unused imports, unused non-exported types,
  and side-effect-free unused locals) across the framework. No behavior or public
  API changes — only declarations the TypeScript compiler proves are unreferenced.
- d4013f0: Fix Messaging enable/disable and webhook setup fetches to use `agentNativePath()`, so they work under a base-path (workspace) mount instead of 404ing at the gateway root.
- d4013f0: Route outbound A2A, Dispatch vault, and scheduling webhook requests through
  SSRF-safe URL fetch paths.

## 0.8.23

### Patch Changes

- c3852e0: Stop inbound email from impersonating real users. The inbound email adapter now
  derives a `senderVerified` flag from the provider's DKIM/SPF
  (`Authentication-Results`) results, and dispatch only grants a sender's real
  identity — their API keys, org secrets, personal instructions, and ownable data
  — when the message is DKIM/SPF-verified for the From domain AND that address is a
  real org member. Unverified or spoofed `From:` headers fall back to a synthetic,
  credential-less owner. Linked identities (`/link`) are unchanged. The legacy
  "trust the From header" behavior can be restored with
  `DISPATCH_TRUST_UNVERIFIED_EMAIL_SENDER=1` (off by default).

## 0.8.22

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- f400c81: Add `create-pylon-ticket` action to Dispatch for escalating blockers, unmatched `#customer-*` routing, or follow-ups that need tracking — uses `PYLON_API_KEY` from the Vault. Instrument the agent chat with Sentry captures when the auth-error card stays visible past auto-recovery (`auth_error_card_stuck`) and when SSE reconnect times out (`reconnect_no_progress`) so we can chase the "occasional Reload UI required" symptom.
- ffd3d00: Add first-class workspace app audience metadata with route-level public/protected page access.

### Patch Changes

- d1a90ac: CLI + dispatch shell fixes from create-workflow feedback:
  - `create`: scaffold `packages/pinpoint` when the user selects `slides` or
    `videos`. Their `package.json` declares `@agent-native/pinpoint:
workspace:*`, but the templates-meta entries were missing
    `requiredPackages: ["pinpoint"]`, so `pnpm install` blew up with
    `ERR_PNPM_WORKSPACE_PKG_NOT_FOUND`. The existing e2e test now covers
    every template with `@agent-native/*` workspace deps so a regression
    surfaces in CI instead of on the user's machine.
  - `create`: per-template progress messages during scaffolding
    (`Scaffolding Slides (3/4)...`, `Adding shared packages...`) and a
    concrete "this is done" stop message, replacing the single static
    "Working... no action needed" line that made a multi-app workspace
    feel hung.
  - `create`: detect `pnpm` on PATH before printing the outro. If it's
    missing, the next-steps block now leads with `npm install -g pnpm`
    instead of dumping the user at `zsh: command not found: pnpm`.
  - `create`: Dispatch is now always scaffolded into a new workspace
    rather than being a recommended-but-optional pick. The picker only
    lists the optional apps; the workspace note explains that Dispatch is
    always included as the control plane. `--template=forms` (or any
    non-Dispatch list) still works — Dispatch gets unioned in. New
    regression test asserts this.
  - Auth guard: local-dev convenience for `NODE_ENV=development`. When
    the `user` table has no real users yet, the first unauthenticated
    page GET transparently signs up (and signs in) a `dev@local` account
    and 302s back to the requested URL, instead of showing the sign-up
    form. A developer running `pnpm dev` lands straight in the app. Once
    any real account exists the auto-create short-circuit fires and the
    regular login flow takes over. Opt out with
    `AGENT_NATIVE_DISABLE_AUTO_DEV_ACCOUNT=1`. Production is unaffected.
  - `DispatchShell`: page-title info icon is now a click-driven Popover
    instead of a hover-only Tooltip, and the trigger button has a
    proper hover background so it reads as clickable. Clicking the icon
    (the natural gesture, and the only available one on touch) did
    nothing before.
  - `create`: clean up the partially-scaffolded directory when scaffolding
    fails (e.g. flaky network during the template download). Without this
    the first failure left the workspace dir on disk, and the next
    `agent-native create <name>` rejected the same name with "Directory
    already exists" — forcing a manual `rm -rf` before retrying.
  - Dispatch apps list: filter dotfile directories (e.g.
    `.agent-native-tmp-*` extraction sidecars) when reading the
    workspace's `apps/` directory. The temp dir is a sibling of the
    target so it appeared at the top of the apps grid mid-scaffold,
    looking like a stray entry.
  - Dispatch onboarding: register a "Create your first app" step at order
    5 so it sits above the Slack/Telegram secret-onboarding steps. A
    brand-new workspace was leading with "Connect Slack" before the user
    had even added an app, which felt confusing.
  - Agent system prompt (chat-in-browser-on-localdev): when a user asks to
    scaffold a new workspace app from a localhost browser tab, point them
    at \`npx @agent-native/core@latest add-app\` first since they're already in
    that terminal. The desktop / Claude Code / Codex / Builder.io
    alternatives still follow for general source-editing work.

- 97ca0db: Dispatch's catch-all `/$appId` route now falls back to first-party template deploy URLs (e.g. `http://localhost:8084` for forms in dev, `https://forms.agent-native.com` in prod) when no workspace manifest is loaded. Previously, visiting `/forms` on hosted dispatch — or in framework dev where each template runs on its own port — forced the auth guard, then dropped the user on dispatch's "Page not found" pane after the post-login reload. Now the catch-all reads the built-in agent registry and redirects to the real app.
- f80dc8c: Fix two bugs in `resolveCatchAllTarget` (the `/dispatch/<appId>` fallback resolver, used when no explicit dispatch route matches):
  - Honour `app.url` from the workspace manifest. Workspaces can point at externally-hosted apps via an absolute URL on the manifest entry; the resolver was ignoring that field and falling through to the local path. `app.url` now takes precedence over `app.path`.
  - Normalize `app.path` instead of silently rewriting to `/${appId}`. When the manifest path doesn't start with a slash (`path: "my-forms"`) the previous code returned `/${appId}`, which routed to the wrong app whenever an entry's mounted path differed from its id. Now the leading slash is just prepended, preserving the path.

  Both surfaced by the Builder PR-review bot on #651.

- b5b6f22: `resolveCatchAllTarget` now validates `app.url` is an absolute http(s) URL before letting it take precedence over `app.path`. Previously any non-empty string would win — including bare hostnames like `"forms.example.com"` (no protocol, browser would treat the redirect as a relative path inside the gateway and 404) or `javascript:` schemes (phishing vector). Mirrors the validation in `normalizeWorkspaceAppUrl` (deploy CLI), inlined to avoid pulling that module into the runtime path. 3 new spec cases (bare hostname rejected, non-http(s) scheme rejected, trailing slash stripped). Flagged by the Builder bot review on #652.
- d1a90ac: Integrations page: long connector names now truncate cleanly inside the tile and reveal the full name on hover. Previously the label could overflow past the tile edge on narrow grid columns.
- d1a90ac: Operations → Messaging tile layout cleanup. The Docs / "Open Slack apps" / "Open BotFather" header links now share a single ghost-button style with consistent external-link icons. Each tile gets a divider before its action footer so the Enable / Set up webhook buttons sit in a clear footer row. The disabled Enable button now explains _why_ via a tooltip, replacing the redundant "Save the required credentials before enabling…" helper paragraph.
- d1a90ac: Several feedback fixes:
  - **Dispatch back-button to `/dispatch/dispatch/overview`.** `dispatchNavLinkTarget` (the helper that decides whether NavLink should manually prepend the workspace mount prefix) read `window.__reactRouterContext.basename` to detect the router's basename. If that global wasn't set yet at render time, the helper double-prefixed the `to` prop, the router then prepended its own basename, and the resulting `/dispatch/dispatch/<route>` landed in browser history — clicking back from any dispatch page later took the user to that 404. The helper now mirrors `entry.client.tsx`'s basename calculation directly from `window.location.pathname`, removing the context-global race. `routerPath` (in both the package and the template copy) also iteratively strips the basename so any doubly-prefixed path that snuck into `application_state.navigate` doesn't get partially-stripped here and re-prefixed by the router back to the bad URL.
  - **"Use Builder" CTA stuck after connect (web).** The Builder upsell CTA in `AgentPanel` opens Builder in a `<a target="_blank">` tab, not a popup, so it never started the `useBuilderConnectFlow` polling loop — `useBuilderConnectUrl` was fetched once on mount and never refreshed, leaving the CTA in the "Use Builder" state after the user came back to the original tab. The callback success HTML now posts a `builder-connect-success` BroadcastChannel + window.opener message (mirroring the existing error-path broadcast), and `useBuilderConnectUrl` listens on BroadcastChannel + `window.message` + `focus` + `visibilitychange` + the existing `agent-engine:configured-changed` event, refetching `/builder/status` on any of them. Also dispatches `agent-engine:configured-changed` when status first reports configured so the rest of the chat tree updates without a full reload.
  - **Firebase `auth/popup-blocked` in desktop Builder connect.** Builder's `/cli-auth` page signs into Google via `signInWithPopup`, which calls `window.open()`. Inside the Electron OAuth `BrowserWindow` we create for the Builder flow, there was no `setWindowOpenHandler`, so Electron's default silently blocked the popup — Firebase reported `auth/popup-blocked`, the parent OAuth window never received the result, and the user saw a blank screen that then closed. The OAuth window now returns `action: "allow"` for https child popups and constructs the child as another `BrowserWindow` sharing the same `session` so Firebase's `window.opener.postMessage` handshake reaches back.
  - **`resolveScopedBuilderCredential` tracing.** The Builder credential lookup walked user → org → workspace silently; when "I connected Builder but chat says use Builder" reports come in, there was no way to tell which scope answered or whether none did. Each branch now logs the scope, email, orgId, and hit/miss outcome (matching the existing always-on tracing in `resolveSecret` for BUILDER\_\* keys).

- ce9e355: Default Dispatch vault access to all workspace apps, add manual grant mode, sync vault keys into encrypted app secrets, and fix org-scoped vault listing.
- ce9e355: Save generated workspace app descriptions, make Dispatch app metadata editable, and include workspace app names/descriptions in A2A agent context.

## 0.6.1

### Patch Changes

- 704951d: fix(dispatch): replace inline "Loading..." with skeletons + stop `/dispatch/dispatch` redirect loop

  Six dispatch loading states were rendering the literal string "Loading..." (or "Loading…", "Loading app status...") instead of skeleton placeholders. This made the UI feel cheap and inconsistent with the rest of the framework.

  Now using `<Skeleton>` placeholders shaped like the content that's about to render in:
  - `approval.tsx` — full-page approval preview card (was: centered "Loading...")
  - `overview.tsx` — Recent activity list under Operations detail (was: small "Loading..." next to the section header)
  - `vault.tsx` — Secrets tab count badge and the empty list area (was: inline "Loading...")
  - `workspace.tsx` — Workspace Resources count and tab list area (was: inline "Loading...")
  - `apps.$appId.tsx` — Workspace app detail card (was: "Loading app status...")
  - `app-keys-popover.tsx` — App-keys grant popover list (was: "Loading…")

  Also fixes a redirect loop on `/dispatch/dispatch` (the catch-all hit when something tries to navigate to dispatch from inside dispatch). The catch-all loader resolved the dispatch entry from the workspace manifest and redirected to `app.path` (`/dispatch`), but `useActionQuery`'s 2s poll re-fired the `window.location.assign(href)` effect each tick, leaving the page stuck on a "Loading…" state with the URL refreshing forever. Both `loader` and the new `clientLoader` now short-circuit to `appPath("/overview")` when `appId === "dispatch"`, and the component renders `<Navigate replace>` for the same case so SPA navigations resolve immediately.

### Minor Changes

- 04fe544: feat(integrations): redesign the Integrations page as service-grouped Connectors. The page now groups by credential key (OpenAI, Stripe, Slack, …) across every app in the workspace, and the new Connect dialog creates the vault secret, grants it to every app that wants it, and syncs in one flow. Old per-app progress cards and individual integration rows are replaced by a flat list of providers with their connect status.

### Patch Changes

- 04fe544: fix: bounce `/dispatch/<workspace-app-id>` to `/<workspace-app-id>` so Builder.io's "navigate to /<id>" calls — and any OAuth round-trip whose callbackURL captured that wrong path — land on the actual workspace app instead of a 404 inside Dispatch's chrome.
- 04fe544: fix(dispatch): make the `/dispatch/<appId>` server-side bounce work in production deploys and after live workspace changes by reading the same env-→file-→filesystem manifest fallback chain that the rest of agent discovery uses, instead of only checking `AGENT_NATIVE_WORKSPACE_APPS_JSON`.

  Core now exports `loadWorkspaceAppsManifest()` and the `WorkspaceAppManifestEntry` type from `@agent-native/core/server/agent-discovery`, so other server entrypoints can resolve the workspace manifest without re-implementing the fallback.

## 0.5.1

### Patch Changes

- 98d56cd: Increase vertical spacing between sections on Dispatch pages so section headings (Getting started, At a glance, Operations detail, etc.) read as distinct groups instead of running together.

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- dd3090e: Add a three-dots menu to each workspace app card with **Hide from list** (per-viewer), **Restore to list**, and **Remove from list** (for pending Builder branches). Hidden apps are reachable from a "Show N hidden apps" expander at the bottom of the page. Also add an "Add a template" section to the Apps page that lists first-party templates not yet installed under `apps/` and scaffolds them via `agent-native add-app` on click. New actions: `archive-workspace-app`, `unarchive-workspace-app`, `remove-pending-workspace-app`, `list-available-workspace-templates`, `scaffold-workspace-app`.

### Patch Changes

- dd3090e: Wire `scaffold-workspace-app`, `unarchive-workspace-app`, `remove-pending-workspace-app`, and `list-available-workspace-templates` into the `dispatchActions` registry. Followup to the actions added in the previous release — they were imported but never exposed to the agent.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 8fa51d9: Add agent actions for managing workspace apps from Dispatch: `scaffold-workspace-app`, `archive-workspace-app`, `unarchive-workspace-app`, `remove-pending-workspace-app`, and `list-available-workspace-templates`. Backed by the new archived-apps + available-templates surface in `app-creation-store`.

### Patch Changes

- 3b88628: Fix lazy workspace dev root routing, live app discovery, and generated app dependency startup.

## 0.2.15

## 0.2.13

### Patch Changes

- b07f933: Fix workspace app card links and key popover triggers.
- b07f933: Clarify workspace app creation instructions to reuse hosted first-party apps as A2A neighbors instead of cloning or nesting templates.

## 0.2.12

### Patch Changes

- 5115f28: Add Dispatch knowledge packs to workspace resources and let new-app flows grant them alongside vault keys.

## 0.2.11

### Patch Changes

- 4caaa4f: Keep workspace app creation on same-origin gateway routes and stop child dev servers from advertising private ports.
- 4caaa4f: Dispatch overview page polish.

## 0.2.10

- 7a849c3: Show the shared organization switcher in the Dispatch sidebar footer.

## 0.2.8

- 471bf1e: Show Builder.io LLM usage as agent credit spend when Builder is the active provider.

## 0.2.6

### Patch Changes

- 2e99cca: Fix workspace scaffolding for the Design template and clarify local Dispatch setup.

## 0.2.5

- 24781d0: Internal app-creation-store tweaks for spawned dispatch apps.

## 0.2.4

### Patch Changes

- 977af2b: Route Dispatch overview prompts to Builder chat in Builder frames and keep the app agent sidebar collapsed there by default.

## 0.2.3

### Patch Changes

- dca4f6d: Replace native title hints on interactive controls with shadcn tooltips.
- dca4f6d: Expose Dispatch Tailwind source directives, preserve the packaged index route redirect in the template shell, and show Dispatch navigation/chat controls at desktop sizes.

## 0.2.2

### Patch Changes

- e375642: Add `@agent-native/core/usage` subpath export for `getUsageSummary` so server-side consumers (Cloudflare Workers / Pages) can import it without hitting the curated browser entry. Switch dispatch's usage-metrics store to the new subpath, fixing the dispatch CF Pages build failure.
- Updated dependencies [bcb2069]
- Updated dependencies [e375642]
  - @agent-native/core@0.8.0

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- 4e3631b: Add `publishConfig.provenance: true` so `pnpm publish` (called by `changeset publish` from the auto-publish workflow) requests an OIDC token from GitHub Actions and publishes via npm trusted publisher. Without this, `pnpm publish` looked for token-based auth and failed with `ENEEDAUTH`.
- Updated dependencies [4e3631b]
  - @agent-native/core@0.7.85

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- a75a89c: Add Dispatch workspace usage metrics and preserve app ids in token usage rows.

### Patch Changes

- a75a89c: In Builder.io's editor frame, `sendToAgentChat` now keeps content prompts self-targeted so the embedded app's own `AgentSidebar` receives them. Code requests still delegate to Builder via `builder.submitChat`. Drops the explicit `isInBuilderFrame()` branching from dispatch's home composer — the routing now lives in core.
- a75a89c: Recommend Dispatch more clearly during workspace scaffolding and add a packaged Dispatch extension API for workspace-owned tabs.
- Updated dependencies [a75a89c]
- Updated dependencies [a75a89c]
