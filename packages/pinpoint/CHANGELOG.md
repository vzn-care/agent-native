# @agent-native/pinpoint

## 0.1.16

### Patch Changes

- 52cce19: Shrink the dispatch and pinpoint install footprint by removing code and
  dependencies nothing could reach. Dispatch drops the unused pre-auth routing
  helper — `rootDispatchRedirect` had no callers and was not re-exported from
  `./server` or any other published subpath — along with the `@libsql/client` and
  `h3` dependencies, which had no imports in the package but were still installed
  for every consumer. Pinpoint drops the `HistoryDropdown` and `SettingsPanel`
  overlay components, which were never rendered by the overlay and were not
  reachable from any of its `.`, `./react`, `./primitives`, `./server`, or
  `./types` entry points. No exported API changes.

## 0.1.15

### Patch Changes

- 8df32f6: Publish the latest Builder link tracking updates.

## 0.1.14

### Patch Changes

## 0.1.13

### Patch Changes

- 38ca6fa: Make annotation badges appear from a natural scale and respect reduced-motion preferences.

## 0.1.12

### Patch Changes

- f43d34c: Stage atomic writes inside the data directory so saves work when /tmp is a different filesystem.

## 0.1.11

### Patch Changes

- 823d635: Upgrade the workspace toolchain to TypeScript 7 (`tsc`) with a side-by-side TypeScript 6 API package for tools that still need programmatic access. Replace `@typescript/native-preview` / `tsgo` with the stable `typescript` 7 release.

## 0.1.10

### Patch Changes

- 2a03c35: Adopt the native TypeScript and oxfmt package build baselines.

## 0.1.7

### Patch Changes

- d4013f0: Remove unused imports, dead state, no-op plugin hooks, and debug logging from package internals.

## 0.1.6

### Patch Changes

- 3107f96: Preserve MCP tool error and read-only metadata through action execution, and allow Pinpoint's empty test suite to pass intentionally.

## 0.1.5

### Patch Changes

- 1ba9738: Keep the pinpoint toolbar inside the viewport when the agent sidebar is open by tracking the visible sidebar width via MutationObserver + ResizeObserver and clamping toolbar position + drag bounds.

## 0.1.4

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [bcb2069]
- Updated dependencies [e375642]
  - @agent-native/core@0.8.0

## 0.1.3

### Patch Changes

- 4e3631b: Add `publishConfig.provenance: true` so `pnpm publish` (called by `changeset publish` from the auto-publish workflow) requests an OIDC token from GitHub Actions and publishes via npm trusted publisher. Without this, `pnpm publish` looked for token-based auth and failed with `ENEEDAUTH`.
- Updated dependencies [4e3631b]
  - @agent-native/core@0.7.85
