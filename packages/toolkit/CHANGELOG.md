# @agent-native/toolkit

## 0.10.7

### Patch Changes

- 52cce19: Stop the agent composer from locking into a silently dead state. An
  engine-readiness check that timed out or failed is now kept distinct from a
  confirmed "no provider configured": it leaves the composer usable instead of
  disabling it, and retries on a backoff instead of latching until reload. The
  2.5s client budget that a single warm-server status probe routinely lost is
  now a 15s abort ceiling rather than a deadline the probes race. A composer is
  only ever disabled when the "Connect AI" affordance renders alongside it.

## 0.10.6

### Patch Changes

- 8afb252: Allow newly created empty collaborative editors to persist their first real user edit after the shared document finishes loading.

## 0.10.5

### Patch Changes

- 0e2c19d: Use borderless accent styling for shared secondary controls and organization pickers.
- 0e2c19d: Align shared chat history rails with left-aligned New Chat controls and animate chat-list expansion using intrinsic sizing.
- 0e2c19d: Expose a shared command-menu open event and sidebar footer action composition primitive.

## 0.10.4

### Patch Changes

- 4b734be: Give `SharedRichEditor` Notion-style block grips by default and keep the caret
  inside blocks created through the shared slash-command menu.

## 0.10.3

### Patch Changes

- 180b41d: Preserve native pointer, keyboard, accessibility, and ref props when legacy Toolkit buttons are composed as menu triggers.

## 0.10.2

### Patch Changes

- 2254362: Center full-page empty chat surfaces consistently and quiet the shared chat history rail.

## 0.10.1

### Patch Changes

- c15d20f: Harden browser and CLI error handling and hide editor commands for disabled features.
- c15d20f: Expand design-system conformance coverage for uncontrolled tooltip and menu
  opening, and align the example adapters with those default-open semantics.
- c15d20f: Show a soft rotating blue glow for live realtime voice sessions and brighten it while the agent is working.

## 0.10.0

### Minor Changes

- f0da2e0: Add the styling-runtime-agnostic custom design system contract, safe component adapters, semantic theme tokens, and build-time theme CSS generation. New scaffolded apps now include the explicit design-system module, ToolkitProvider seam, and toolkit dependency so custom adapters can be registered from the first render.

### Patch Changes

- f0da2e0: Harden custom design system color gamut handling, semantic default-adapter behavior, sharing controller reuse, and build-time theme cascade ordering. Add complete MUI and Ant Design Chat examples that exercise the public conformance contract, and route normalized settings, sharing, sidebar, and agent-panel chrome through the registered semantic adapters.
- f0da2e0: Preserve normalized core control icon sizing and semantic button styling while keeping settings defaults and sharing overlays consistent.
- f0da2e0: Serialize realtime voice responses and recover from overlapping response requests without ending the voice session.
- f0da2e0: Make the Dispatch chat composer recover from unavailable AI status checks and keep its Add menu clickable.
- f0da2e0: Route the Builder connection card and chat history rail through semantic design-system components while preserving their default presentation and shared controller paths.

## 0.9.1

### Patch Changes

- 03a043e: Make realtime voice the clear primary microphone action, remember the selected input mode, improve speech waveform responsiveness, and show a shine while the voice agent is working.
- 03a043e: Prevent reasoning messages from losing their assistant UI provider, and add a progressively disclosed recent-chat rail for app sidebars.

## 0.9.0

### Minor Changes

- 0341a7d: Add an ejectable dashboard presentation kit with cards, tables, date ranges, chart state rendering, and layout helpers.

## 0.8.3

### Patch Changes

- 5c78d2d: Fix cramped calendar day grid under Tailwind v4 and make the date picker responsive: smaller cell size on mobile, 20% smaller on desktop, and a viewport-bounded popover width.

## 0.8.2

### Patch Changes

- dcd0810: Add clear creation actions to empty resource views and improve collaboration usage feedback.

## 0.8.1

### Patch Changes

- 6d96437: Add clear creation actions to empty resource views and improve collaboration usage feedback.

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- 8453025: Publish ejection units for every Toolkit entry point so apps can take ownership of individual presentation features while preserving protected runtime contracts.

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- e53a34e: Move the reusable ChatHistoryList and its stylesheet to the Toolkit chat-history entrypoint while preserving Core compatibility imports. Adopt it across first-party full-page chat sidebars, ship readable Toolkit source, and add generated-app guidance for selective app-owned UI customization.

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- 01a3f27: BREAKING: move the portable composer, rich editor, collaboration display, visual controls, and shared UI primitives to focused Toolkit entrypoints. Core's removed deep compatibility paths now throw an actionable migration error, and moved symbols are removed from the legacy `@agent-native/core/client` barrel. Run `npx @agent-native/core@latest upgrade --codemods --yes` to rewrite supported imports. Framework-wired composer APIs remain available from `@agent-native/core/client/composer`; bare reusable composer UI is available from `@agent-native/toolkit/composer`.

## 0.5.1

### Patch Changes

- 079e19a: Adopt focused Core client entrypoints and ship package migration metadata where applicable.

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- b6d7f87: Move portable rich-editor, context presentation, and visual design controls into Toolkit while preserving Core compatibility re-exports, and add accurate side-effect metadata to capability packages.

## 0.4.10

### Patch Changes

- 7effaba: Ignore malformed collaboration presence payloads and keep recoverable server chat timeout handoffs out of Sentry error issues.

## 0.4.9

### Patch Changes

- c690750: Button press feedback now eases instead of snapping: include the native `scale` property in the Button transition list (Tailwind v4 compiles `active:scale-*` to `scale`, which the previous `transform`-only list didn't animate).

## 0.4.8

### Patch Changes

- ffad302: Allow command dialogs to configure the underlying command root for custom ranking and controlled selection.
- ffad302: Ease in the backdrop blur for instant command dialogs while keeping the command surface immediately responsive.

## 0.4.7

### Patch Changes

- 38ca6fa: Motion polish across shared UI: overlay primitives (tooltip, popover, select, context/menubar menus) now scale from their trigger, exit with ease-out, and respect prefers-reduced-motion; new shared easing tokens (--ease-drawer, --ease-collapse, --ease-out-strong); press feedback on the shared Button and composer send button; GPU-friendly progress fills; chat tool cells (files-changed/edit/write) animate open/closed like other disclosures.

## 0.4.6

### Patch Changes

- f43d34c: Release the updated skill guidance and portable drawer component types.

## 0.4.5

### Patch Changes

- a91535c: Keep alert dialogs centered above full-app overlays.

## 0.4.4

### Patch Changes

- 680b1eb: Scan TypeScript sources from `@agent-native/toolkit/styles.css` so dropdown and popover `z-[250]` utilities are generated in monorepo apps where `dist/` is gitignored.

## 0.4.3

### Patch Changes

- 823d635: Add explicit `browser` and `development` export conditions so Vite 8 / Rolldown can resolve toolkit subpaths (including `./collab-ui`) in Fusion agent-native starter projects.
- 823d635: Upgrade the workspace toolchain to TypeScript 7 (`tsc`) with a side-by-side TypeScript 6 API package for tools that still need programmatic access. Replace `@typescript/native-preview` / `tsgo` with the stable `typescript` 7 release.

## 0.4.2

### Patch Changes

- ec523c4: Show the current sharing visibility icon directly in shared ShareButton triggers and use the users-group glyph for organization visibility.

## 0.4.1

### Patch Changes

- e1ad535: Portal dropdown submenu content so nested menus are not clipped by parent menu overflow.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 9d8c83c: Ship a `@agent-native/toolkit/styles.css` entrypoint that registers the package's
  compiled components with Tailwind via a self-relative `@source` directive. Apps
  that render toolkit UI should `@import "@agent-native/toolkit/styles.css";` in
  their `app/global.css` (after the core stylesheet).

  Without it, Tailwind never generated classes that appear only inside toolkit
  components -- e.g. the dropdown/popover content's `z-[250]` and enter/exit
  animations -- so those components rendered with no `z-index` (drawing behind app
  panels) and looked broken/invisible even though they were mounted. This mirrors
  how `@agent-native/core` self-registers its client styles.

- 9d8c83c: Add Toolkit provider overrides, collaboration UI, and sharing UI entrypoints while preserving core client compatibility re-exports. The core re-exports are temporary migration shims; the long-term dependency direction is Toolkit composing core runtime APIs, not core permanently owning reusable app-building UI. Future behaviorful kits should be extracted one at a time, with Sharing as the first candidate to validate access checks, action-backed data, and share-link UI together.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 277d115: Ship a `@agent-native/toolkit/styles.css` entrypoint that registers the package's
  compiled components with Tailwind via a self-relative `@source` directive. Apps
  that render toolkit UI should `@import "@agent-native/toolkit/styles.css";` in
  their `app/global.css` (after the core stylesheet).

  Without it, Tailwind never generated classes that appear only inside toolkit
  components — e.g. the dropdown/popover content's `z-[250]` and enter/exit
  animations — so those components rendered with no `z-index` (drawing behind app
  panels) and looked broken/invisible even though they were mounted. This mirrors
  how `@agent-native/core` self-registers its client styles.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- b24446e: Add `@agent-native/toolkit` for reusable app-building UI, move shared template primitives into it, and keep core UI shim imports working through compatibility re-exports.
