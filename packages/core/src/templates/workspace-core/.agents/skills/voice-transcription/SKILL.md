# Voice Transcription

Click-to-toggle microphone inside the sidebar composer turns speech into
text. Users configure live transcription separately from AI cleanup in
Settings → Voice Transcription. The feature is available in every template
that renders `TiptapComposer`.

## UX rules

- **Always show the mic alongside the send button.** Cursor replaces send
  with mic when the composer is empty; their users complain. We keep both
  visible — Lovable does the same.
- **Click-to-toggle, not push-to-talk.** More forgiving in a sidebar, avoids
  host-app hotkey clashes. Keyboard shortcut is `Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+M` and
  `Escape` cancels mid-recording.
- **Transcript lands in the composer, editable, never auto-sent.** Insert at
  the caret via `editor.chain().focus().insertContent(text).run()`.
- **No CSS transitions for the recording state.** Framework rule; use static
  brand color (`#625DF5`) instead of pulses.
- **Icon:** Tabler `IconMicrophone` (idle) / `IconPlayerStopFilled` (recording).
  Never use a sparkle or robot icon.
- **Errors via inline alert or toast, never `window.alert`.**

## Source And Cleanup

Settings must keep these as separate choices:

- **Live transcription source**: `mac-native`, `google-realtime`, or `batch`.
- **AI cleanup**: independent off/on toggle. Cleanup uses managed Gemini first
  when a managed AI services connection is configured, then BYOK Gemini (`GEMINI_API_KEY`).
  Gemini cleanup/title/summary generation is not a live STT source.

`application_state["voice-transcription-prefs"]` stores
`{ transcriptionMode, provider, instructions }`. The legacy `provider` field
is still written for old clients and batch provider preferences:

| Value             | Meaning                                                        | Needs key                    |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `mac-native`      | Native macOS/Tauri speech path; web clients normalize to browser-native where needed | No                           |
| `google-realtime` | Dedicated WebSocket → Google Speech-to-Text gRPC `StreamingRecognize` path | `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` |
| `batch`           | Upload audio after stop through the existing batch route       | Builder/Gemini/Groq/OpenAI depending on fallback |
| `auto` provider   | Browser SpeechRecognition when supported; server batch fallback chain otherwise | No key needed in browsers that support SpeechRecognition |
| `builder-gemini`  | Managed Gemini Flash-Lite batch/cleanup preference             | Managed AI services account connected |
| `gemini`          | Direct Google Gemini BYOK batch/cleanup preference             | `GEMINI_API_KEY`             |
| `groq`            | Groq Whisper batch preference                                  | `GROQ_API_KEY`               |
| `openai`          | OpenAI Whisper batch preference                                | `OPENAI_API_KEY`             |
| `browser`         | Legacy native/browser live speech preference                   | No                           |

Default behavior:

- The shared web settings/composer default to Batch / `auto`. In `auto` mode,
  `useVoiceDictation` uses `startBrowser()` (Web Speech API, no key required,
  incremental streaming) when the browser supports `SpeechRecognition`. It only
  falls back to the MediaRecorder → server upload path when `SpeechRecognition`
  is not available (e.g. Firefox). This means dictation works out of the box in
  Chrome, Edge, and Safari without any API key configuration.
- Dedicated macOS Tauri-native surfaces may save `mac-native`, but do not
  assume the shared React settings default to it.
- Old stored `builder` values are treated as `builder-gemini`.
- Old stored `browser` values are treated as `mac-native`.
- Saved `google-realtime` preferences must never hit `/_agent-native/transcribe-voice`. They go through the dedicated session bridge `POST /_agent-native/transcribe-stream/session`, which mints an opaque ai-services websocket session and keeps the Google service-account JSON off the client.
- In the current bridge, the Google option is only actually ready when both the user's `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` secret exists and a managed AI services connection is configured, because the framework mints the managed ai-services session before streaming begins.

## Key resolution (server)

`transcribe-voice.ts` is batch-only. Do not add realtime streaming to this
route. Google Speech-to-Text realtime uses a dedicated audio-frame protocol:
client audio frames → `/_agent-native/transcribe-stream/session` →
ai-services WebSocket → Google gRPC `StreamingRecognize` → partial / final
transcript events. Use the canonical docs URL:
https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text/v2/docs/streaming-recognize

Batch routing is based on the user's provider preference:

1. If `builder-gemini` and `resolveHasBuilderPrivateKey()` → calls `transcribeWithBuilder({ model: "gemini-3-1-flash-lite" })` via Builder proxy, or uses Builder Gemini Flash-Lite to clean up a live native/browser transcript when the desktop client sends text instead of audio.
2. If `builder` and `resolveHasBuilderPrivateKey()` → legacy alias; prefer `builder-gemini`.
3. If `gemini` → resolves `GEMINI_API_KEY` and calls the direct Google Gemini path.
4. If `groq` → resolves `GROQ_API_KEY` and calls Groq's Whisper-compatible endpoint.
5. If `openai` → resolves `OPENAI_API_KEY`:
   - `readAppSecret({ key: "OPENAI_API_KEY", scope: "user", scopeId: session.email })` — user's encrypted secret.
   - `resolveCredential("OPENAI_API_KEY")` — env var + SQL settings fallback.

In auto mode / no preference, the route tries Builder Gemini Flash-Lite first
when Builder is connected, then Gemini BYOK, Groq, and OpenAI.
When a request includes `instructions`, pass them through to the selected LLM
provider. Gemini uses them in the transcription prompt, Builder receives them
as transcription/cleanup instructions, and Whisper-compatible providers receive
them as provider prompt/context.

Requests may also include a multipart `voiceContext` JSON field. Parse it with
`parseVoiceContextPack()` from `@agent-native/core/voice` and pass the resulting
context through `buildVoiceGuidanceBlock()`; do not hand-roll separate prompt
formats. The context pack is for bounded snippets, active references, route/page
metadata, and preferred vocabulary/replacements only. Browser-native and Google
realtime final text can POST `{ text, provider, instructions, voiceContext }` to
`/_agent-native/transcribe-voice` when AI cleanup is enabled; batch audio can
send the same `voiceContext` field with its audio upload.

Never hardcode a shared key. Never log the value. Never echo it back to the
client.

## Overriding per-template

Templates can:
- **Disable the mic**: pass `voiceEnabled={false}` to `TiptapComposer`.
- **Replace the button**: wrap `TiptapComposer` and render your own `extraActionButton` (the framework mic sits between `extraActionButton` and the send button).
- **Pre-register provider keys as `required: true`**: call `registerRequiredSecret(...)` from your own server plugin when a template needs a specific BYOK provider in onboarding.

## Don'ts

- Don't call transcription providers from the client — go through `/_agent-native/transcribe-voice` so the user's secret stays server-side.
- Don't remove the cancel affordance — mic permission abuse paranoia is real.
- Don't auto-submit the transcript — users always edit before sending.
- Don't copy Cursor's "hide send when empty" pattern — it confuses users.
