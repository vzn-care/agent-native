# A2A Protocol (Agent-to-Agent)

## Rule

Agents can call other agents using the A2A protocol. This is a JSON-RPC-based protocol for agent discovery and communication. Use it when work should go to a different agent entirely — not the local agent chat.

## Why

Agent-native apps don't exist in isolation. A mail agent might need analytics data. A calendar agent might need to search issues. A2A lets agents discover each other, send messages, and receive structured results — all over HTTP with bearer token auth.

## How to Enable A2A (Server Side)

Add `mountA2A()` to a server plugin:

```ts
// server/plugins/a2a.ts
import { mountA2A } from "@agent-native/core/a2a";

export default defineNitroPlugin((nitro) => {
  const app = nitro.h3App;

  mountA2A(app, {
    name: "Analytics Agent",
    description: "Queries analytics data across providers",
    version: "1.0.0",
    skills: [
      {
        id: "query-data",
        name: "Query Data",
        description: "Run analytics queries across connected data sources",
        tags: ["analytics", "data"],
        examples: ["What were last week's signups?", "Show conversion rates"],
      },
    ],
    apiKeyEnv: "A2A_API_KEY", // env var holding the bearer token
    streaming: true,          // enable message/stream method
  });
});
```

This mounts the agent-native A2A endpoints:

- `GET /.well-known/agent-card.json` — public agent discovery (no auth required)
- `POST /_agent-native/a2a` — primary JSON-RPC endpoint (bearer token auth required)

The client may fall back to `POST /a2a` for external or legacy peers that only
expose that simple path. New agent-native apps should document and call the
`/_agent-native/a2a` endpoint.

## The Config Object

```ts
interface A2AConfig {
  name: string;           // agent display name
  description: string;    // what this agent does
  version?: string;       // semver version (default: "1.0.0")
  skills: AgentSkill[];   // capabilities this agent exposes
  handler?: A2AHandler;   // custom message handler
  apiKeyEnv?: string;     // env var name for bearer token auth
  streaming?: boolean;    // enable streaming responses
}

interface AgentSkill {
  id: string;             // unique skill identifier
  name: string;           // human-readable name
  description: string;    // what this skill does
  tags?: string[];        // categorization tags
  examples?: string[];    // example prompts
}
```

## Agent Card

The agent card is auto-generated at `GET /.well-known/agent-card.json`. Other agents fetch this to discover what skills are available:

```json
{
  "name": "Analytics Agent",
  "description": "Queries analytics data across providers",
  "url": "https://analytics.example.com",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "protocolVersion": "0.3",
  "capabilities": { "streaming": true },
  "skills": [
    {
      "id": "query-data",
      "name": "Query Data",
      "description": "Run analytics queries across connected data sources"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Calling Another Agent

### Simple: `callAgent()` (text in, text out)

```ts
import { callAgent } from "@agent-native/core/a2a";

const answer = await callAgent(
  "https://analytics.example.com",
  "What were last week's signups?",
  { apiKey: process.env.ANALYTICS_A2A_KEY },
);
// answer is a plain string
```

### Fast bounded read: `invokeAgentAction()`

When the caller knows the exact receiver-owned read action and arguments, skip
the receiver's model loop:

```ts
import { invokeAgentAction } from "@agent-native/core/a2a";

const { result } = await invokeAgentAction({
  target: "analytics",
  action: "gong-calls",
  input: { company: "Acme", days: 90, includeTranscripts: true },
  userEmail,
  orgDomain,
  orgSecret,
});
```

The receiver still owns schema validation, credentials, access scoping, audit
attribution, and exposure policy. Direct invocation is available only for
cataloged, authenticated, explicitly exposed read-only actions that do not
require approval. Its JWT is audience-bound to the receiving app. Use normal
message delegation for planning, synthesis, multi-step work, or mutations.

Inside an agent loop, `call-agent` exposes the same path with `action` + `input`;
omit `message` and `taskId` in that mode.

### Retry safety and trace linkage

`call-agent` automatically derives an owner-scoped idempotency key from the
originating turn, target, and exact message. If a retry reaches the receiver
after the caller timed out, asynchronous `message/send` returns the existing
active or completed task instead of starting a duplicate agent run. Failed and
canceled tasks release the key for an intentional retry; synchronous calls are
never deduplicated. Lower-level clients may pass an
`idempotencyKey` explicitly; keep it stable for the same logical submission and
change it when the work changes. Dedupe is scoped to the JWT-authenticated
owner and verified org, and keys are limited to 128 characters.

The caller also forwards bounded correlation metadata (`callerApp`,
`callerThreadId`, `parentRunId`, `parentTurnId`, and direct-read
`invocationId`). These fields
are telemetry hints only. Receivers must continue to derive identity,
ownership, org scope, access, and approval from the verified request context.
Delegated model loops emit `$ai_generation` with A2A/MCP lineage, while direct
reads emit the content-free `$a2a_read_invoke` event; neither event includes
action arguments or results.

### Advanced: `A2AClient` (full control)

```ts
import { A2AClient } from "@agent-native/core/a2a";

const client = new A2AClient(
  "https://analytics.example.com",
  process.env.ANALYTICS_A2A_KEY,
);

// Discover agent capabilities
const card = await client.getAgentCard();

// Send a message and get a task back
const task = await client.send({
  role: "user",
  parts: [{ type: "text", text: "What were last week's signups?" }],
});
// task.status.state === "completed"
// task.status.message.parts[0].text === "Last week: 1,247 signups..."

// Stream responses
for await (const update of client.stream({
  role: "user",
  parts: [{ type: "text", text: "Detailed breakdown by day" }],
})) {
  console.log(update.status.state, update.status.message);
}
```

### Agent activity in delegated chat

Agent Native peers attach a bounded `data` part with
`kind: "agent-native/agent-activity"` to in-progress and terminal task status
messages. It contains the same user-visible reasoning summaries shown in the
receiving app, tool names and completion states, elapsed time, and progressive
response text. It never includes tool inputs, tool results, credentials, or
hidden provider reasoning.

`call-agent` reads this optional part while it polls an asynchronous task and
renders the remote work as a nested agent run. Unknown A2A peers do not need to
implement the extension: their ordinary status and final text still render in
the same nested block. Treat activity data as untrusted presentation content;
never use it for identity, authorization, approval, routing, or artifact
validation.

### Carrying explicit chat authorization

When the authenticated caller has an exact consequential action that the user
explicitly authorized in the originating chat, pass the tool name and complete
input as `approvedActions`. The receiver accepts these grants only from a
JWT-verified user identity, converts each one to the same content-addressed key
as its local approval gate, and consumes it once:

```ts
await client.send(message, {
  async: true,
  approvedActions: [
    {
      tool: "send-email",
      input: { to, subject, body, attachments },
    },
  ],
});
```

Never infer authorization from request prose or broaden the input. A changed
recipient, body, attachment, or tool produces a different key and follows the
receiver's normal approval-required path. Static API keys and unsigned callers
cannot carry these grants.

## JSON-RPC Methods

| Method           | Purpose                          | Auth required |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------- |
| `message/send`   | Send a message, get a task back  | Yes           |
| `message/stream` | Send a message, stream responses | Yes           |
| `actions/invoke` | Invoke one exposed read action   | Yes, JWT      |
| `tasks/get`      | Get task status by ID            | Yes           |
| `tasks/cancel`   | Cancel a running task            | Yes           |

## Task Lifecycle

Tasks go through these states:

```
submitted → working → completed
                    → failed
                    → canceled
                    → input-required
```

- **submitted** — message received, not yet processing
- **working** — agent is processing the request
- **completed** — agent finished, result in `status.message`
- **failed** — agent encountered an error
- **canceled** — task was canceled via `tasks/cancel`
- **input-required** — agent needs more information from the caller

## Security

A2A uses bearer token auth. The server reads the token from the environment variable specified by `apiKeyEnv`:

- Set `A2A_API_KEY=<A2A_API_KEY_VALUE>` in the server's deployment environment
- Callers pass it as `Authorization: Bearer <A2A_API_KEY_VALUE>`
- The agent card endpoint (`/.well-known/agent-card.json`) is public — no auth needed for discovery

Never hardcode the bearer token in source, docs, prompts, app state, action
descriptions, client bundles, or examples. A2A tokens are deploy-level secrets
unless a specific app designs a scoped credential flow; read them from secure
runtime configuration and never log or return them.

## Message Parts

Messages contain typed parts:

| Part type | Fields                              | Use for                    |
| --------- | ----------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| `text`    | `{ type: "text", text: "..." }`     | Natural language messages  |
| `file`    | `{ type: "file", file: { ... } }`   | Files (bytes or URI)       |
| `data`    | `{ type: "data", data: { ... } }`   | Structured JSON data       |

## Example: Cross-Agent Workflow

A mail agent calls an analytics agent to include data in an email draft:

```ts
// actions/draft-with-analytics.ts
import { callAgent } from "@agent-native/core/a2a";
import { writeAppState } from "@agent-native/core/application-state";

export default async function (args: string[]) {
  // Ask the analytics agent for data
  const stats = await callAgent(
    process.env.ANALYTICS_AGENT_URL!,
    "Summarize last week's key metrics in 3 bullet points",
    { apiKey: process.env.ANALYTICS_A2A_KEY },
  );

  // Create a draft with the analytics data
  await writeAppState("compose-analytics-report", {
    id: "analytics-report",
    to: "team@example.com",
    subject: "Weekly Analytics Summary",
    body: `Hi team,\n\nHere are last week's numbers:\n\n${stats}\n\nBest`,
    mode: "compose",
  });
}
```

## All Types

All types are exported from `@agent-native/core/a2a`:

```ts
import type {
  A2AConfig,
  A2AHandler,
  A2AHandlerContext,
  A2AHandlerResult,
  AgentCard,
  AgentSkill,
  AgentCapabilities,
  Task,
  TaskState,
  TaskStatus,
  Message,
  Part,
  TextPart,
  FilePart,
  DataPart,
  Artifact,
  JsonRpcRequest,
  JsonRpcResponse,
} from "@agent-native/core/a2a";
```
