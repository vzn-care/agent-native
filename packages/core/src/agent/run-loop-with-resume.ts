/**
 * Wraps `runAgentLoop` with two layered recovery mechanisms so a single hosted
 * invocation can survive interruptions without showing the user a dead chat:
 *
 * 1. **Soft timeout** — an inner timer that aborts the LLM call before the
 *    hosting function's hard limit (Lambda 75s, Vercel 60s, etc.) so we have a
 *    chance to gracefully wind down and append a continuation nudge. Without
 *    this the function gets killed mid-stream and the user sees a frozen
 *    spinner.
 *
 * 2. **Resumable-error continuation** — when the LLM call errors with a
 *    transport- or gateway-level interruption (Builder gateway 45s timeout,
 *    socket hang up, ECONNRESET, upstream 5xx that survived engine retries),
 *    we save the conversation prefix, append a "continue from where you left
 *    off" message, and run another LLM call. Anthropic's prompt cache makes
 *    the resume call dramatically faster than the cold first attempt, and the
 *    agent gets explicit context that it was cut off so it doesn't re-do
 *    completed work.
 *
 * Both paths route through `appendAgentLoopContinuation` so the agent sees a
 * uniform "continue" instruction regardless of which recovery fired.

/**
 * Derive the per-turn tool-call journal from the durable run-event ledger and,
 * when there is anything to report, append a STRUCTURED note to the message
 * prefix so the resumed model:
 *   - does NOT re-execute tool calls that already completed (avoiding duplicate
 *     side effects like re-sending an email or re-creating a ticket), and
 *   - is explicitly told about any tool call that started but whose outcome was
 *     never recorded ("interrupted, unknown outcome") so it can decide.
 *
 * This is additive to the existing "continue from where you left off" nudge —
 * it is appended right after it. When the journal is empty (no completed or
 * interrupted tool calls — e.g. a turn with no tool activity, or a clean
 * continuation), nothing extra is appended and resume behavior is byte-for-byte
 * what it was before. Best-effort: any ledger read/parse failure is swallowed so
 * a journal hiccup can never block a recovery that would otherwise succeed.
 *
 * This prompt-level journal is paired with tool-layer enforcement in
 * production-agent.ts/runToolCall, which refuses to re-execute a journaled-
 * complete write tool (returning the journaled result instead). See
 * `tool-call-journal.ts` (`findCompletedJournalEntry`) for the keying used.
