/**
 * Per-turn tool-call journal — derived (not separately recorded) from the
 * existing run-event ledger. Borrowed from Flue's durable-execution journal:
 * when an agent run resumes after an interruption (gateway/transport drop, cold
 * start, soft-timeout auto-continue), we classify the tool calls already in the
 * ledger so the resumed model does NOT re-execute side effects it already
 * completed (re-sending an email, re-creating a ticket) and so it is explicitly
 * told about any tool call that started but whose outcome was never recorded.
 *
 * IMPORTANT — this is a pure read-over-the-ledger view. There is no new
 * recording hook anywhere in the hot path. The classification reuses the exact
 * positional `tool_start` → `tool_done` matching that `thread-data-builder.ts`
 * already relies on to rebuild durable turns:
 *
 *   - `tool_start` events carry `{ tool, input }` (no tool-call id at this
 *     layer; the ledger event stream omits it).
 *   - `tool_done` events carry `{ tool, result }`.
 *   - A `tool_done` is matched to the OLDEST still-open `tool_start` for the
 *     same tool name (FIFO per tool), mirroring how the dispatch loop emits a
 *     start immediately before its matching done.
 *
 * A `tool_start` with no matching `tool_done` is the dangerous case: the call
 * began, its side effect may or may not have landed, and the interruption ate
 * the result. We surface those as "interrupted / unknown outcome" so the model
 * decides rather than blindly re-running.
 *
 * Two layers of protection are built on this: (1) a prompt-level note on resume
 * (see `run-loop-with-resume.ts`) telling the model what already completed, and
 * (2) tool-layer enforcement in `production-agent.ts`/`runToolCall`, which uses
 * `findCompletedJournalEntry(...)` to refuse re-executing a journaled-complete
 * write tool — returning the journaled result instead of running the side
 * effect again. Layer 2 is the stronger guarantee.
