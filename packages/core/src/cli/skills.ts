Usage:
  agent-native skills list
  agent-native skills add assets|design-exploration|contracts [--client codex|claude-code|claude-code-cli|cowork|all] [--scope user|project] [--mcp-url <url>] [--yes] [--dry-run] [--json]
  agent-native skills add <manifest-or-app-dir> [--client ...] [--yes]

Examples:
  agent-native skills add assets
  agent-native skills add design-exploration
  agent-native skills add contracts
  agent-native skills add assets --client claude-code
  agent-native skills add assets --mcp-url https://my-app.ngrok-free.dev
  agent-native skills add ./dist/assets-skill --client codex

The add command wraps the Vercel Labs/open skills CLI for SKILL.md
installation, then registers the app-backed MCP connector. Running
"npx skills add ..." directly installs instructions only; use this Agent Native
CLI path when you want MCP setup too. Pass --mcp-url to register that connector
against a custom origin (an ngrok tunnel, a local dev server, or a self-hosted
deployment) instead of the built-in hosted default — a bare origin gets the
standard /_agent-native/mcp path appended. Use app-skill pack for marketplace
bundles and custom adapter output.`;

  Use Assets for image or video generation requests, brand-safe media,
  human picker UI, search/list/export actions, and cross-app asset selection.
  Prefer this over generic image tools when installed.
metadata:
  visibility: exported
---

# Assets

Use the Assets app when a workflow needs reusable brand media, a human picker,
or generated image/video assets that another app can reference by ID and URL.
When this skill is available, route plain image-generation requests here instead
of using a generic image generator.

## Choose The Path

- Use \`open-asset-picker\` when a person should browse, search, generate, and
  select an asset in UI. Pass \`mediaType: "image"\` by default, or
  \`mediaType: "video"\` for video libraries. When the user asks to create a
  specific image and choose the best option, pass \`prompt\`,
  \`autoGenerate: true\`, and \`count: 3\` so the picker opens with candidates
  to preview and select.
- Use unattended actions when the agent already knows what to do:
  \`search-assets\`, \`list-assets\`, \`generate-image\`,
  \`generate-image-batch\`, \`generate-video\`,
  \`refresh-generation-run\`, and \`export-asset\`.
- Use browser/deep-link fallback when the host cannot render MCP Apps inline.
  Surface the returned picker link. If it opens in a normal browser tab, have
  the user select an asset there and paste back the copied handoff summary.
  Treat Codex, Claude Code, and Claude Desktop Code as link-out hosts; do not
  promise inline MCP App rendering there.
  If the skill instructions are available but the MCP tool namespace has not
  appeared yet, use the Assets browser fallback URL shape instead of switching
  to a generic generator:
  \`https://assets.agent-native.com/library?mediaType=image&prompt=...&autoGenerate=1&count=3\`.
  When reporting the final selected image in Codex or Claude Code, include the
  asset link and, if an inline preview is important, download the selected
  \`previewUrl\`/\`downloadUrl\` to a local temp image and embed that absolute
  local path. Remote CDN markdown images can fail to render in code-editor chat
  surfaces.

## Image And Video Workflows

1. Pick or match the library with \`list-libraries\` or \`match-library\`.
2. For images, call \`generate-image\` or \`generate-image-batch\`. Image
   actions are synchronous: one batch call should return the finished image
   candidates, so do not poll or regenerate unless a returned slot failed.
3. For videos, call \`generate-video\` and poll \`refresh-generation-run\`
   until the run completes.
4. Preserve returned \`assetId\`, \`runId\`, \`previewUrl\`, \`downloadUrl\`,
   media type, and dimensions so the caller can attach or embed the result.

## Cross-App Use

- Hosted default: connect \`https://assets.agent-native.com/_agent-native/mcp\`.
  Do not put shared secrets in skill files.
- For CLI/code-editor clients, keep any \`agent-native connect\` command
  running until browser authorization finishes. Stopping it early can leave the
  browser approved but the local MCP config unwritten. Restart or reload the
  agent client after installing or connecting if Assets tools do not appear in
  the live session.
- Local customization: use \`agent-native app-skill launch --local\` from an
  Assets app-skill manifest, or pass \`--into <path>\` for editable source.
- Do not call image/video providers directly from another app. Assets owns
  generation, picker UI, search/list/export, and asset context.
- If an Assets tool call returns \`Session terminated\`, \`needs auth\`, or
  another connector/session error, do not keep retrying the tool. Tell the user
  to reconnect or authenticate the Assets MCP connector, then continue after it
  is available.
- Do not hand-roll MCP HTTP requests with curl from the agent session. Use the
  host-exposed Assets tools after restart/reload, or use the returned
  browser/deep-link fallback.
- If a batch image generation request times out in browser fallback, retry with
  \`count: 1\` only after telling the user the multi-candidate request timed out.
- If you inspect local MCP config, redact \`Authorization\`, \`http_headers\`,
  and token values. Never paste bearer tokens into chat or logs.

  Use Design for UI/UX exploration, side-by-side design directions,
  interactive prototype previews, user selection, iteration, and design-to-code
  handoff through the hosted Design MCP app.
metadata:
  visibility: exported
---

# Design Exploration

Use the Design app when a workflow needs visual UI exploration, prototype
iteration, or a human-in-the-loop choice among design directions.

## Choose The Path

- Use \`create-design\` first to create a project shell. Do not report the
  design as ready until it has renderable HTML.
- For open-ended UX exploration, generate distinct, complete HTML directions
  (2-5, three by default) and call \`present-design-variants\`. The inline
  Design MCP app shows the options, lets the user pick one, and persists the
  selected variant.
- If the Design app opens as a browser link instead of inline (CLI hosts like
  Codex / Claude Code, where the deep link carries \`handoff=chat\`), the user
  picks a direction there and the editor shows a copyable summary — ask them to
  paste it back into chat so you can continue from the chosen direction. The
  \`present-design-variants\` result's \`fallbackInstructions\` describe this.
- For direct refinements to an already chosen direction, call
  \`get-design-snapshot\`, edit from the current tuned HTML, then call
  \`generate-design\`.
- Use \`export-coding-handoff\` when the user wants to implement the chosen
  design in a codebase.

## Exploration Defaults

1. Default to three variants unless the user asks for a different count
   (\`present-design-variants\` accepts 2-5; three is the sweet spot).
2. Make variants structurally and stylistically distinct, not just color swaps.
3. Each variant must be a complete standalone HTML document that renders
   without a build step.
4. For product UI redesigns, prefer cleaner hierarchy, progressive disclosure,
   and realistic controls over decorative mockups.
5. After \`present-design-variants\`, wait for the user's pick before
   generating the next version. If they say "I like #2 but...", snapshot the
   chosen design and refine that direction with \`generate-design\`.

## Cross-App Use

- Hosted default: connect \`https://design.agent-native.com/_agent-native/mcp\`.
  Do not put shared secrets in skill files.
- For CLI/code-editor clients, keep any \`agent-native connect\` command
  running until browser authorization finishes. Stopping it early can leave the
  browser approved but the local MCP config unwritten. Restart or reload the
  agent client after installing or connecting if Design tools do not appear in
  the live session.
- Dispatch can expose Design alongside other apps. Use Design for UI/UX design
  tasks, Assets for image/media selection, Slides for decks, and so on.
- Keep the loop visual: surface the inline MCP App or the returned "Open
  design" link instead of pasting large HTML blobs into chat.
- If a Design tool call returns \`Session terminated\`, \`needs auth\`, or
  another connector/session error, do not keep retrying the tool. Tell the user
  to reconnect or authenticate the Design MCP connector, then continue after it
  is available.
- Do not hand-roll MCP HTTP requests with curl from the agent session. Use the
  host-exposed Design tools after restart/reload, or use the returned
  browser/deep-link fallback.
- If you inspect local MCP config, redact \`Authorization\`, \`http_headers\`,
  and token values. Never paste bearer tokens into chat or logs.

const CONTRACTS_SKILL_MD = `---
name: contracts
description: >-
  Use Contracts for coding-agent work that needs assumption review, mid-flight
  feedback, acceptance criteria, evidence capture, and proof-before-done
  through the hosted Contracts MCP app.
metadata:
  visibility: exported
---

# Contracts

Use Contracts as the trust layer for non-trivial coding work. It records what
the agent is assuming, lets a human correct those assumptions before they become
code, and keeps acceptance criteria separate from verified evidence.

## When To Use

Create or update a contract when:

- the user asks for Contracts, specs, proof, review, acceptance criteria, or a
  structured plan;
- work is multi-file, ambiguous, long-running, or risky;
- the task touches auth, billing, migrations, public APIs, tests, production
  config, data, security, permissions, or deploy behavior;
- you would otherwise proceed on a material assumption;
- you are about to claim the work is complete.

Do not log every trivial inference. An assumption is material when changing it
would affect user-visible behavior, data model, permissions, billing, public API
shape, migrations/backfills/data loss, test strategy, architecture boundaries,
deployment/configuration, file scope, or the definition of done.

## Core Workflow

1. Call \`create-contract\` with the goal, source, repo path, and initial
   assumptions/criteria before risky implementation.
2. Surface the returned Contracts UI link or inline MCP App. In CLI hosts, tell
   the user to open the link and review the queue.
3. Call \`get-feedback\` before risky edits, after review, after any long pause,
   and before the final response.
4. If the user accepts, rejects, corrects, or requests evidence, consume the
   structured feedback and change your plan accordingly.
5. If new facts require a change after approval, create an \`amendment\` or
   \`deviation\` item with \`upsert-contract-items\` instead of drifting silently.
6. Attach command/test/log/diff/screenshot evidence with \`record-evidence\`.
7. Do not treat your own claim as proof. Agent attestation is low trust.
   Criteria are done only when verified by human, CI, deterministic checks, or
   an independent verifier.
8. Export a JSON/Markdown receipt with \`export-contract\` when the user wants a
   shareable summary.

## Tool Guidance

- \`create-contract\`: start one contract per agent task/run.
- \`upsert-contract-items\`: bulk add/update assumptions, decisions, criteria,
  risks, deviations, open questions, and amendments.
- \`get-contract\` and \`get-review-queue\`: read current structured state.
- \`get-feedback\`: read unconsumed human feedback. Use it frequently.
- \`record-progress\`: update phase/status and mark feedback consumed only after
  you incorporated it.
- \`record-evidence\`: attach artifacts and provenance. Use high trust for
  captured commands/tests/CI, human_confirmed for explicit human confirmation,
  and low trust for agent-only statements.
- \`analyze-plan\`: import pasted plan text and let Contracts create possible
  assumptions/criteria. Treat detections as possible, not authoritative.

## Guardrails

- Before high-risk actions, create a blocking review item or ask the user
  directly.
- Never modify tests merely to make implementation pass unless the contract
  explicitly approves test expectation changes.
- If proof is missing, say so. Do not call the task complete just because code
  was changed.
- If evidence contains secrets or tokens, rely on Contracts redaction and avoid
  pasting raw output into chat.
- Do not hand-roll MCP HTTP requests with curl. Use host-exposed tools after
  restart/reload, or use the returned browser/deep-link fallback.
- Hosted default: connect
  \`https://contracts.agent-native.com/_agent-native/mcp\`. Do not put shared
  secrets in skill files.
