  agent-native skills add assets|design-exploration|visual-plan|visual-questions|ui-plan|visualize-plan|context-xray [--client codex|claude-code|claude-code-cli|cowork|all] [--scope user|project] [--mcp-url <url>] [--no-connect] [--yes] [--dry-run] [--json]

Examples:
  agent-native skills add assets
  agent-native skills add design-exploration
  agent-native skills add visual-plan
  agent-native skills add visual-plan --no-connect
  agent-native skills add context-xray --client all
  agent-native skills add assets --client claude-code
  agent-native skills add assets --mcp-url https://my-app.ngrok-free.dev
  agent-native skills add ./dist/assets-skill --client codex

The add command installs the SKILL.md instructions, registers the app-backed
MCP connector, and then authenticates it in one step so you do not hit an OAuth
wall on the first tool call. Authentication reuses "agent-native connect":
OAuth-capable clients (Claude Code) get a URL-only entry and a /mcp authenticate
prompt, while Codex / Cowork run the browser device-code flow. In a
non-interactive shell or CI the auth step is skipped and the exact
"agent-native connect <url>" command is printed instead.

Running "npx skills add ..." directly installs instructions only; use this Agent
Native CLI path when you want MCP setup and auth too. Pass --no-connect to
register the connector without authenticating (leave auth to the host or run
"agent-native connect" later). Pass --mcp-url to register that connector against
a custom origin (an ngrok tunnel, a local dev server, or a self-hosted
deployment) instead of the built-in hosted default — a bare origin gets the
standard /_agent-native/mcp path appended. Use app-skill pack for marketplace
bundles and custom adapter output.`;

  Use Assets for image or video generation requests, brand-safe media,

  Prefer this over generic image tools when installed.
metadata:
  visibility: exported
---

# Assets

Use the Assets app when a workflow needs reusable brand media, a human picker,
or generated image/video assets that another app can reference by ID and URL.
When this skill is available, route plain image-generation requests here instead
of using a generic image generator.

## Choose The Path

- Use \`open-asset-picker\` when a person should browse, search, generate, and
  select an asset in UI. Pass \`mediaType: "image"\` by default, or
  \`mediaType: "video"\` for video libraries. When the user asks to create a
  specific image and choose the best option, pass \`prompt\`,
  \`autoGenerate: true\`, and \`count: 3\` so the picker opens with candidates
  to preview and select.
- Use unattended actions when the agent already knows what to do:
  \`search-assets\`, \`list-assets\`, \`generate-image\`,
  \`generate-image-batch\`, \`generate-video\`,
  \`refresh-generation-run\`, and \`export-asset\`.
- Use browser/deep-link fallback when the host cannot render MCP Apps inline.
  Surface the returned picker link. If it opens in a normal browser tab, have
  the user select an asset there and paste back the copied handoff summary.
  Treat Codex, Claude Code, and Claude Desktop Code as link-out hosts; do not
  promise inline MCP App rendering there.
  If the skill instructions are available but the MCP tool namespace has not
  appeared yet, use the Assets browser fallback URL shape instead of switching
  to a generic generator:
  \`https://assets.agent-native.com/library?mediaType=image&prompt=...&autoGenerate=1&count=3\`.
  When reporting the final selected image in Codex or Claude Code, include the
  asset link and, if an inline preview is important, download the selected
  \`previewUrl\`/\`downloadUrl\` to a local temp image and embed that absolute
  local path. Remote CDN markdown images can fail to render in code-editor chat
  surfaces.

## Image And Video Workflows

1. Pick or match the library with \`list-libraries\` or \`match-library\`.
2. For images, call \`generate-image\` or \`generate-image-batch\`. Image
   actions are synchronous: one batch call should return the finished image
   candidates, so do not poll or regenerate unless a returned slot failed.
3. For videos, call \`generate-video\` and poll \`refresh-generation-run\`
   until the run completes.
4. Preserve returned \`assetId\`, \`runId\`, \`previewUrl\`, \`downloadUrl\`,
   media type, and dimensions so the caller can attach or embed the result.

## Cross-App Use

- Hosted default: connect \`https://assets.agent-native.com/_agent-native/mcp\`.
  Do not put shared secrets in skill files.
- For CLI/code-editor clients, keep any \`agent-native connect\` command
  running until browser authorization finishes. Stopping it early can leave the
  browser approved but the local MCP config unwritten. Restart or reload the
  agent client after installing or connecting if Assets tools do not appear in
  the live session.
- Local customization: use \`agent-native app-skill launch --local\` from an
  Assets app-skill manifest, or pass \`--into <path>\` for editable source.
- Do not call image/video providers directly from another app. Assets owns
  generation, picker UI, search/list/export, and asset context.
- If an Assets tool call returns \`Session terminated\`, \`needs auth\`, or
  another connector/session error, do not keep retrying the tool. Tell the user
  to reconnect or authenticate the Assets MCP connector, then continue after it
  is available.
- Do not hand-roll MCP HTTP requests with curl from the agent session. Use the
  host-exposed Assets tools after restart/reload, or use the returned
  browser/deep-link fallback.
- If a batch image generation request times out in browser fallback, retry with
  \`count: 1\` only after telling the user the multi-candidate request timed out.
- If you inspect local MCP config, redact \`Authorization\`, \`http_headers\`,
  and token values. Never paste bearer tokens into chat or logs.

  handoff through the hosted Design MCP app.
metadata:
  visibility: exported
---

# Design Exploration

Use the Design app when a workflow needs visual UI exploration, prototype
iteration, or a human-in-the-loop choice among design directions.

## Choose The Path

- Use \`create-design\` first to create a project shell. Do not report the
  design as ready until it has renderable HTML.
- For open-ended UX exploration, generate distinct, complete HTML directions
  (2-5, three by default) and call \`present-design-variants\`. The inline
  Design MCP app shows the options, lets the user pick one, and persists the
  selected variant.
- If the Design app opens as a browser link instead of inline (CLI hosts like
  Codex / Claude Code, where the deep link carries \`handoff=chat\`), the user
  picks a direction there and the editor shows a copyable summary — ask them to
  paste it back into chat so you can continue from the chosen direction. The
  \`present-design-variants\` result's \`fallbackInstructions\` describe this.
- For direct refinements to an already chosen direction, call
  \`get-design-snapshot\`, edit from the current tuned HTML, then call
  \`generate-design\`.
- Use \`export-coding-handoff\` when the user wants to implement the chosen
  design in a codebase.

## Exploration Defaults

1. Default to three variants unless the user asks for a different count
   (\`present-design-variants\` accepts 2-5; three is the sweet spot).
2. Make variants structurally and stylistically distinct, not just color swaps.
3. Each variant must be a complete standalone HTML document that renders
   without a build step.
4. For product UI redesigns, prefer cleaner hierarchy, progressive disclosure,
   and realistic controls over decorative mockups.
5. After \`present-design-variants\`, wait for the user's pick before
   generating the next version. If they say "I like #2 but...", snapshot the
   chosen design and refine that direction with \`generate-design\`.

## Cross-App Use

- Hosted default: connect \`https://design.agent-native.com/_agent-native/mcp\`.
  Do not put shared secrets in skill files.
- For CLI/code-editor clients, keep any \`agent-native connect\` command
  running until browser authorization finishes. Stopping it early can leave the
  browser approved but the local MCP config unwritten. Restart or reload the
  agent client after installing or connecting if Design tools do not appear in
  the live session.
- Dispatch can expose Design alongside other apps. Use Design for UI/UX design
  tasks, Assets for image/media selection, Slides for decks, and so on.
- Keep the loop visual: surface the inline MCP App or the returned "Open
  design" link instead of pasting large HTML blobs into chat.
- If a Design tool call returns \`Session terminated\`, \`needs auth\`, or
  another connector/session error, do not keep retrying the tool. Tell the user
  to reconnect or authenticate the Design MCP connector, then continue after it
  is available.
- Do not hand-roll MCP HTTP requests with curl from the agent session. Use the
  host-exposed Design tools after restart/reload, or use the returned
  browser/deep-link fallback.
- If you inspect local MCP config, redact \`Authorization\`, \`http_headers\`,
  and token values. Never paste bearer tokens into chat or logs.

 */
const PLAN_SETUP_AUTH_MD = `## Setup & Authentication

There are two ways into Plans.

**Coding agent (CLI).** Install once with the Agent-Native CLI. The command
installs the Plans skills, registers the hosted Plans MCP connector, and
authenticates it in the same step (a one-time browser sign-in at setup — this is
intended), so the first tool call does not hit an OAuth wall:

\`\`\`bash
agent-native skills add visual-plan
\`\`\`

After that, \`/visual-plan\` (and \`/ui-plan\`, \`/visual-questions\`,
\`/visualize-plan\`) generate a plan and open the editor. Pass \`--no-connect\` to
register the connector without authenticating, then run
\`agent-native connect https://plan.agent-native.com\` whenever you are ready.

**Browser (people you share with).** Open the Plans editor and create & edit
with no sign-up — you work as a guest. Sign in only when you want to save or
share; signing in claims the plans you made as a guest into your account.

Sharing and commenting require an account: public/shared plans are viewable by
anyone with the link, but commenting on them needs an agent-native account.

For fully offline, no-account use, run the Plans app locally and sync plans to
your repo as MDX. This local mode is a separate advanced path, not the default
hosted flow.

If a Plans tool returns \`needs auth\`, \`Unauthorized\`, or \`Session terminated\`,
do not keep retrying the tool. Authenticate the connector with
\`agent-native connect https://plan.agent-native.com\` (OAuth-capable hosts can
instead re-run /mcp and choose Authenticate), then continue once the connector
is available.

Hosted default: connect \`https://plan.agent-native.com/_agent-native/mcp\`. Do
not put shared secrets in skill files.`;

# Agent-Native Plans

Agent-Native Plans is structured visual planning mode for coding agents. Build
the plan you would normally write in Markdown, but as a scannable document with
editable blocks mixed in: an optional pan/zoom wireframe canvas on top and a
Notion-like technical document below. The user reacts to visuals first and reads
prose only where it helps.

\`/visual-plan\` is the canonical command and the main entry point. Use \`/ui-plan\`
when the work is primarily product UI and review should start with the screens.
Use \`/visual-questions\` only when the user explicitly wants a visual intake form
before planning. Use \`/visualize-plan\` to turn an existing Codex, Claude Code,
Markdown, or pasted plan into a visual companion.

## When To Use

Create a visual plan when work is multi-file, ambiguous, long-running, risky, or
UI-heavy, when architecture / data flow / UI direction / options / open
questions would be clearer visually, or when the user needs to react to a
direction before you implement.

## Plan Discipline

- **Gate hard.** A polished visual plan is the most expensive plan form; only
  invest when a wrong direction is costly. Skip it for trivial, unambiguous work
  — typos, one-line fixes, a single well-specified function, anything whose diff
  you could describe in one sentence — and just make the change. Never pad a plan
  with filler and never ship a single-step plan.
- **Research before you draft.** Read the real files, actions, schema, and
  patterns first; name actual files, symbols, and data shapes instead of
  inventing them. Check existing \`actions/\` before proposing endpoints and prefer
  named client helpers over raw fetch. Delegate wide exploration to a sub-agent.
- **Planning is read-only.** Make no source edits while building or reviewing the
  plan. Start editing only after the user approves the direction.
- **Clarify vs. assume.** Do not ask how to build it — explore and present the
  approach and options in the plan. Ask a clarifying question only when an
  ambiguity would change the design and you cannot resolve it from the code; use
  the host agent's normal ask-user-question flow and batch 2-4 high-leverage
  questions before finalizing. Do not create visual questions from \`/visual-plan\`.
  Otherwise state the assumption explicitly and proceed, and put anything
  unresolved in an open-questions block.
- **The plan is the approval gate.** After surfacing it, ask the user to review
  and approve before you write code, and name which files/areas the work touches.
  Presenting the plan and requesting sign-off is the approval step — do not ask a
  separate "does this look good?" question.
- **The document is the source of truth, not the chat.** When scope shifts,
  update the plan with \`update-visual-plan\` rather than only changing course in
  chat, and re-read the approved plan before major steps.

## Core Workflow

1. Follow the host agent's normal planning flow: inspect the codebase, delegate
   wide exploration when useful, gather the info needed, and ask native
   clarifying questions as needed before generating the plan.
2. Call \`create-visual-plan\` with the title, brief, source, repo path, and
   structured \`content\` blocks.
3. Compose the canvas from the kit and write the document with native blocks
   (see the two cores below). Keep the document close to the Markdown plan the
   agent would normally output; add diagrams, wireframes, and visual callouts
   only where they clarify the plan. Skip the canvas for non-visual work.
4. Surface the returned Plans link or inline MCP App and ask the user to review.
   Always include the actual URL in chat so the next step is a click in CLI or
   other text-only hosts. When the host exposes an embedded browser/preview panel
   and a tool can open arbitrary URLs there, open the returned plan URL
   automatically for convenient review; do not rely on this as the only handoff.
5. Call \`get-plan-feedback\` before editing, after review, after any long pause,
   and before the final response.
6. Apply changes with \`update-visual-plan\`, preferring targeted \`contentPatches\`.
   When the user wants source-control friendly edits, use
   \`patch-visual-plan-source\` against the MDX files instead of regenerating the
   plan.
7. Export with \`export-visual-plan\` only when the user wants a shareable receipt
   or repo-check-in artifacts.

<!-- SHARED-CORE:wireframe-canvas START -->

## Wireframe & Canvas Core

This section is shared, word for word, by \`/visual-plan\`, \`/ui-plan\`, and
\`/visualize-plan\`. It is the single source of truth for how wireframes and the
canvas work. Do not paraphrase it per command.

**A wireframe is an HTML mockup. The renderer owns the look; you write the
content.** Set \`data.html\` to a self-contained, semantic HTML fragment of the
screen and set \`data.surface\`. The renderer owns the surface footprint/aspect,
the dark/light theme, the hand-drawn font, and the rough.js sketch overlay — you
never write \`<html>\`/\`<body>\`/\`<script>\`/\`<style>\` tags, font-family, hex colors,
or any width/height/coordinates. You write real HTML layout and real product
content; the renderer styles and roughens it.

**A wireframe block's data is an HTML screen plus a surface:**

\`\`\`json
{
  "surface": "browser",
  "html": "<div style=\\"display:flex;flex-direction:column;gap:10px;padding:16px;height:100%\\"><h1>Sign in</h1><p class=\\"wf-muted\\">Use your work email to continue.</p><div class=\\"wf-card\\" style=\\"display:flex;flex-direction:column;gap:10px\\"><label>Email<input value=\\"jane@acme.co\\" /></label><label>Password<input value=\\"••••••••\\" /></label><label style=\\"display:flex;align-items:center;gap:8px\\"><input type=\\"checkbox\\" checked /> Remember me</label><button class=\\"primary\\">Sign in</button></div><a href=\\"#\\">Forgot password?</a></div>"
}
\`\`\`

**Write PLAIN semantic HTML and let the renderer style it.** Bare elements
(\`h1\`/\`h2\`/\`h3\`, \`p\`, \`button\`, \`input\`, \`<input type="checkbox">\`, \`a\`, \`hr\`)
are auto-themed — no classes needed. Helper classes carry the rest:

- \`.wf-card\` / \`.wf-box\` — a bordered, padded container (a panel, a list item).
- \`.wf-pill\` / \`.wf-chip\` — a rounded tag or filter; add \`.accent\`
  (\`<span class="wf-pill accent">\`) for the accent-filled variant.
- \`.wf-muted\` — secondary/muted text (or use \`<small>\`).
- \`button.primary\` or any element with \`[data-primary]\` — the accent-filled
  primary button.

**Use the \`--wf-*\` tokens for any custom color, never hex.** The renderer flips
these on light/dark, so reading them is what keeps a mockup correct in both
themes. For any inline border, background, or text color, reference a token:
\`style="border:1.4px solid var(--wf-line)"\`. The tokens are \`--wf-ink\` (text),
\`--wf-muted\` (secondary text), \`--wf-line\` (borders/dividers), \`--wf-paper\`
(page background), \`--wf-card\` (raised surface), \`--wf-accent\` /
\`--wf-accent-fg\` / \`--wf-accent-soft\` (brand action), \`--wf-warn\`, \`--wf-ok\`,
and \`--wf-radius\`. Never hard-code a hex color and never set \`font-family\` — the
renderer owns the sketch/clean font.

**Lay out with inline \`style\` flex/grid.** You write the real layout —
\`display:flex; flex-direction:column; gap:10px; padding:16px\` and so on — and the
renderer never repositions anything. Compose the actual product: reproduce the
current screen, then show the modification. Real labels, real counts, real dates,
real button text grounded in the screen you read; not lorem or gray bars.

**Surface presets — match the real footprint, never default to desktop+mobile.**
Pick the \`surface\` that matches what the user will actually see:

- \`browser\`: a web page that needs a browser chrome frame around it.
- \`desktop\`: a full desktop app page or app shell.
- \`mobile\`: a phone screen, only when the work is genuinely mobile.
- \`popover\`: a small floating menu, dropdown, or inline popover.
- \`panel\`: a side panel, inspector, or sidebar widget.

The surface locks the footprint and aspect; never set width/height/coordinates.
A sidebar popover renders as a small surface, not a desktop page and a phone
frame. Do not emit \`desktop\` + \`mobile\` variants unless responsive behavior
actually changes the layout. For a component or widget, show one broader
app-context frame only when placement affects understanding, then the focused
component states.

**Modify, don't redesign.** When the task changes an existing screen, reproduce
the current screen's real layout and footprint FIRST, then change only the delta
and call it out with a single annotation. Do not restack the page into a new
layout. For net-new surfaces, compose from the real app shell.

**Zoom in on sub-surfaces, don't redraw the page.** For a small sub-surface (a
popover, menu, dialog, toast), show the full screen once, then add a small
separate artboard whose \`html\` contains ONLY that sub-surface — do not re-draw
the whole page around it, and do not scale a duplicate up. Pick the matching
\`surface\` (e.g. \`popover\`) so the footprint is right; never widen a popover to
page width.

**Loading / skeleton states.** Set \`data.skeleton: true\` on the wireframe and
fill the \`html\` with neutral, textless placeholder geometry — boxes and bars
built as \`<div>\`s with \`background:var(--wf-line)\` and explicit heights/widths,
no labels or copy. The renderer drops borders, sketch, and color into the
skeleton register automatically. Never escape to a \`custom-html\` document block
to fake a loader, and never move a mockup out of the canvas — mockups always
live in canvas artboards.

**Editing an existing mockup.** To change one element, text, or color in an
existing html mockup, do NOT regenerate the frame — call \`update-visual-plan\`
with \`contentPatches: [{ op: "patch-wireframe-html", blockId, edits: [{ find,
replace }] }]\`. Each \`find\` is a unique snippet of the current html (read it
first with \`get-visual-plan\`); set \`all: true\` on an edit to replace every
occurrence. The result is re-sanitized.

**Canvas annotations are designer notes on the artboard.** When a top canvas is
present, sprinkle Figma-style notes near the frames they explain: a short
heading, supporting text, and bullets — plain text layers, never bordered or
shadowed cards, and never a box around a frame. The renderer spaces notes away
from frames, so place each note by the frame it describes. Use an arrow only to
point at one specific control or transition; for a broad frame-level note, write
text beside the frame with no connector. Connectors are for real sequences only —
never fake "Step 1 → Step 2" lines between independent states.

**Do not create overlapping annotations.** Anchor each note to the frame it
explains with \`targetId\` + \`placement\` (top/right/bottom/left). The renderer
parks notes in a gutter beside the frame and lays them out automatically — never
supply x/y or points for anchored notes; hand-placed coordinates fight the
auto-layout and cause the overlap you're trying to avoid. Reserve arrows for a
note that must point at a specific control inside a frame; a note that simply
sits beside its frame needs no arrow.

**Patching.** Edit one wireframe, canvas annotation, or block with targeted \`contentPatches\`
(for example \`update-block\`, \`replace-blocks\`, \`update-canvas-annotation\`) rather
than regenerating the whole plan. \`contentPatches\` are part of the public MCP
action schema, so Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, and other hosts can make surgical
edits. If an agent is working from exported source files, use
\`read-visual-plan-source\` / \`patch-visual-plan-source\`: \`plan.mdx\` holds
frontmatter plus markdown/document blocks, \`canvas.mdx\` holds
\`<DesignBoard>/<Section>/<Artboard>/<Screen>/<Annotation>/<Connector>\`, and the
patch action normalizes the MDX back into the same JSON runtime model. JSON is
the canonical runtime shape; MDX is the repo-friendly authoring/export surface.
In the browser, humans edit \`rich-text\` prose inline; agents should still use
\`update-rich-text\` content patches or source patches for prose, and use
comments/structured patches for canvas, artboard, wireframe, and diagram edits.

**Never emit a titled artboard with no interior wireframe content.** Every artboard you place on the canvas must carry an \`html\` wireframe (or reference a wireframe block via \`blockId\`) — a label-only frame renders as an empty dashed box and is rejected at parse time. If you only have a title, write it as a section header or annotation, not an empty artboard.

**Fill the frame; keep labels short.** Each artboard is a fixed-size surface — compose enough realistic HTML to fill it top to bottom with even vertical rhythm; never leave a large empty band. On desktop/app-shell sidebars, let the nav stack flex to fill (\`flex:1\`) and add any persistent bottom action/status after it so the rail reads complete in taller frames. On mobile especially, flow real rows down the whole screen (status bar, header, then list/detail content) rather than a header floating above a gap. Keep every label short enough to sit on one line within its column — shorten the copy rather than relying on the frame to absorb it (long labels wrap or clip).

**Good example — a contacts list, surface \`browser\`.** A small, real screen
composed from the helper classes and tokens, layout in inline flex, no fonts or
hex colors:

\`\`\`html
<div style="display:flex;flex-direction:column;gap:12px;padding:16px;height:100%">
  <div style="display:flex;align-items:center;justify-content:space-between">
    <h1>Contacts</h1>
    <button class="primary">New contact</button>
  </div>
  <div style="display:flex;gap:6px">
    <span class="wf-pill accent">All 128</span>
    <span class="wf-pill">Favorites</span>
    <span class="wf-pill">Archived</span>
  </div>
  <div class="wf-card" style="display:flex;flex-direction:column;gap:0;padding:0">
    <div style="display:flex;align-items:center;gap:10px;padding:10px 12px;border-bottom:1.4px solid var(--wf-line)">
      <div style="width:32px;height:32px;border-radius:999px;background:var(--wf-accent-soft)"></div>
      <div style="flex:1"><strong>Jane Cooper</strong><br /><small>jane@acme.co</small></div>
      <span class="wf-pill">Lead</span>
    </div>
    <div style="display:flex;align-items:center;gap:10px;padding:10px 12px">
      <div style="width:32px;height:32px;border-radius:999px;background:var(--wf-accent-soft)"></div>
      <div style="flex:1"><strong>Marcus Lee</strong><br /><small>marcus@globex.io</small></div>
      <span class="wf-pill">Customer</span>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
\`\`\`

**Mockups belong on the canvas.** When the user asks for a mockup, UI state,
loading state, prototype, layout, screen, or visual comparison, make the top
canvas the primary home for that visual. Document blocks can explain, compare,
or map implementation, but they should not host the primary mockup just because
\`custom-html\`, screenshots, or prose are easier to produce. If the canvas cannot
represent the requested fidelity, still keep a canvas artboard and call out or
extend the needed canvas renderer capability.

**Legacy kit tree.** Older plans set a \`screen\` array of \`{ el, ...props }\` kit
nodes instead of \`html\`; the renderer still accepts and displays it, but new
plans emit \`html\`. Do not author fresh kit-tree screens — write the HTML mockup
instead. Likewise, old or imported plans may carry coordinate-based regions or
free-float x/y on notes or artboards; those are legacy escape hatches the
renderer still shows but you must never produce. The \`surface\` drives the aspect
and footprint, the canvas auto-places artboards, and the gutter parks notes by
\`targetId\` + \`placement\`; never supply width, height, or coordinates for a new
plan.

## Document Quality Core

This section is shared, word for word, by \`/visual-plan\`, \`/ui-plan\`, and
\`/visualize-plan\`. It is the single source of truth for the document below the
canvas. Do not paraphrase it per command.

**The document is a serious technical plan, not marketing.** Write it the way a
strong Claude or Codex implementation plan reads: outcome-first, prose-first,
self-contained, and specific. State the objective and what "done" means, the
scope and non-goals, the proposed approach with the key decisions and their
rationale, ordered steps that name real files, symbols, actions, and data
shapes, the risks, and a closing verification step (tests, build, or a checkable
behavior). Replace vague prose with specifics; never ship a step like "make it
work." No hero art, gradients, logos, nav bars, slogans, value props, giant
landing-page headings, or marketing cards unless the user explicitly asks.

**Canvas and document never duplicate each other.** The UI story lives on the
canvas with on-canvas annotations; the document carries the technical depth the
canvas cannot show — concrete file/symbol maps, API and data contracts, code
snippets, migration or implementation phases, risks, and validation. Repeat a
wireframe in the document only for a genuinely new detail view or comparison.
Skip the canvas entirely for non-visual work and write a clean rich document.

**Use the right block, and make it carry substance.** For the authoritative,
machine-checked list of block types and their data schemas, call \`get-plan-blocks\`
— it returns the live registry vocabulary (type, MDX tag, placement, key fields)
so you never emit a block the editor cannot render or round-trip:

- \`rich-text\` for plan prose with real bold/italic/code/links and nested lists.
- \`implementation-map\` / \`code-tabs\` for the file map: file path, the
  symbols/components to touch, the reason, risk/coordination notes, and a
  concise syntax-highlighted snippet of the code shape — never the whole file,
  never a prose-only file list.
- \`decision\` for two or three option cards with consequences. These are static
  records; do not style them like clickable tabs or chips unless the renderer
  truly supports changing the selection.
- \`diagram\` for architecture, sequence, data-flow, dependency, or state
  relationships, only when it clarifies something real. Labels must not overlap
  nodes, connectors, or each other.
- \`tabs\` for multiple states, directions, or comparisons. A tab that reveals
  only prose usually means the plan is under-specified — include a relevant
  visual unless the tab is intentionally document-only.
- \`table\`, \`checklist\`, \`callout\` for scannable structure.

**Open questions are callouts, not buried prose.** Surface anything unresolved in
a dedicated open-questions / needs-clarification block. Never put a
questions/decisions wall inside the plan narrative.

**\`custom-html\` is a bounded escape hatch only** — a single complete fragment
inside a block, never \`html\`/\`head\`/\`body\`/\`script\` tags, never a generic
placeholder, density demo, or proof that custom HTML works. Prefer the native
blocks for normal plans. It may support supplemental demos or references, but it
is never the primary home for a requested mockup, UI state, or visual
comparison. If fidelity requires HTML/CSS, image capture, or real React/CSS, the
product fix is canvas support for that artifact type, not moving the mockup into
the document.

**Before handoff, open the plan and check it.** Fix overlap, excessive
whitespace, clipped fragments, misleading inactive controls, poor contrast, and
unreadable diagrams before asking for approval.

## Good vs. Bad Exemplar

**GOOD.** A \`/ui-plan\` for a todo app: a canvas with a \`desktop\` artboard whose
\`data.html\` is a real flex layout — a sidebar of links (\`Inbox 12\`, \`Today 4\`,
\`Done\`), a main column with an \`<h1>Today</h1>\`, accent \`.wf-pill\`s for the
filters, a muted section label \`OVERDUE\`, and \`.wf-card\` task rows carrying real
titles, due dates, and a primary \`button.primary\` — styled only through bare
elements, helper classes, and \`--wf-*\` tokens, so the renderer applies the
correct desktop footprint, theme, and one subtle whole-frame wobble. Plain-text
designer notes sit spaced off the frame, pointing only at the controls that need
explanation. Below it, a Claude/Codex-grade document: objective and
done-criteria, an \`implementation-map\` naming the real components and actions
with short highlighted snippets, a \`decision\` card weighing two real approaches,
and a validation step — none of it repeating the canvas. This is the bar.

**BAD.** A \`data.html\` with hard-coded hex colors, a \`font-family\`, or fixed
pixel width/height; gray placeholder bars "insinuating" text on a non-skeleton
frame; a forced desktop + mobile pair for a popover; floating bordered
annotation cards hugging the frames; a fresh hand-authored kit-tree \`screen\`
instead of \`html\`; a mockup escaped into a document \`custom-html\` block; and a
marketing-style document with a hero heading and value props that just restates
what the canvas already shows. Never produce this.

## Tool Guidance

- \`create-visual-plan\`: start one structured visual plan per agent task/run.
- \`create-ui-plan\`: start a UI-first plan when the work is primarily product UI.
- \`create-visual-questions\`: use only for the explicit \`/visual-questions\`
  command, not as \`/visual-plan\` preflight.
- \`visualize-plan\`: build a visual companion from an existing text plan.
- \`update-visual-plan\`: revise content, status, or comments; prefer
  \`contentPatches\` over regenerating the whole plan.
- \`read-visual-plan-source\`: read the normalized plan as \`plan.mdx\`,
  optional \`canvas.mdx\`, optional \`.plan-state.json\`, and JSON.
- \`patch-visual-plan-source\`: apply granular MDX AST patches by stable block,
  artboard, annotation, component, or wireframe-node id.
- \`import-visual-plan-source\`: create or replace a plan from an MDX folder.
- \`get-visual-plan\`: read the current structured plan, exported HTML, and
  annotations; it also returns the MDX folder for source workflows.
- \`get-plan-feedback\`: read unconsumed human feedback. Use it frequently.
- \`export-visual-plan\`: export HTML, Markdown fallback, structured JSON, and MDX
  files for repo check-in.

When the user critiques a plan's look or structure, fix the renderer or this
skill — never hand-edit one stored plan. Turn feedback into better guidance.

## Setup & Authentication

There are two ways into Plans.

**Coding agent (CLI).** Install once with the Agent-Native CLI. The command
installs the Plans skills, registers the hosted Plans MCP connector, and
authenticates it in the same step (a one-time browser sign-in at setup — this is
intended), so the first tool call does not hit an OAuth wall:

\`\`\`bash
agent-native skills add visual-plan
\`\`\`

After that, \`/visual-plan\` (and \`/ui-plan\`, \`/visual-questions\`,
\`/visualize-plan\`) generate a plan and open the editor. Pass \`--no-connect\` to
register the connector without authenticating, then run
\`agent-native connect https://plan.agent-native.com\` whenever you are ready.

**Browser (people you share with).** Open the Plans editor and create & edit
with no sign-up — you work as a guest. Sign in only when you want to save or
share; signing in claims the plans you made as a guest into your account.

Sharing and commenting require an account: public/shared plans are viewable by
anyone with the link, but commenting on them needs an agent-native account.

For fully offline, no-account use, run the Plans app locally and sync plans to
your repo as MDX. This local mode is a separate advanced path, not the default
hosted flow.

If a Plans tool returns \`needs auth\`, \`Unauthorized\`, or \`Session terminated\`,
do not keep retrying the tool. Authenticate the connector with
\`agent-native connect https://plan.agent-native.com\` (OAuth-capable hosts can
instead re-run /mcp and choose Authenticate), then continue once the connector
is available.

Hosted default: connect \`https://plan.agent-native.com/_agent-native/mcp\`. Do
not put shared secrets in skill files.

# UI Plan

Use \`/ui-plan\` when the task is primarily about product UI, user flows,
interaction states, component layout, or visual direction. The reviewable UI
comes first; implementation detail comes after the user has something concrete to
react to.

\`/visual-plan\` remains the general command for architecture, backend, refactors,
and mixed work. Use \`/visual-questions\` only when the user explicitly wants
visual intake before planning, and \`/visualize-plan\` when a text plan already
exists.

## Plan Discipline

- **Gate hard.** Use a UI plan when the surface is new, ambiguous, spans several
  screens or states, or the direction needs agreement before coding. Skip it for
  cosmetic one-liners — a color, a label, a spacing tweak — and just make the
  change. Never ship a single-step or filler plan.
- **Research before you draft.** Read the real components, routes, and design
  tokens first; ground every mockup and the file map in actual files and symbols.
  Delegate wide exploration to a sub-agent when the surface is large.
- **Planning is read-only.** Make no source edits while building or reviewing.
  Start editing only after the user approves the UI direction.
- **Clarify vs. assume.** Do not ask how to build the UI — present the direction
  and options as mockups and tabs. Ask a clarifying question only when an
  ambiguity would change the design; use the host agent's normal
  ask-user-question flow and batch 2-4 before finalizing. Do not create visual
  questions from \`/ui-plan\`. Otherwise state the assumption in the plan and
  proceed.
- **The plan is the approval gate.** Ask the user to review and approve the UI
  direction before you write code, and name the files/areas the work touches.

## UI-First Workflow

1. Follow the host agent's normal planning flow: inspect the codebase, gather
   the UI/component context needed, and ask native clarifying questions as needed
   before generating the plan.
2. Call \`create-ui-plan\` with a UI-specific title, brief, source, repo path, and
   structured \`content\`. The canvas comes first, the document second.
3. Compose the top canvas from the kit (see the cores below): the key artboards
   with real product content, designer notes, and connectors only for real
   sequences. Skip the canvas when wireframes would not clarify the work.
4. Continue below as a concise technical document that stays close to the
   Markdown plan the agent would normally output — not a second copy of the
   canvas — covering concrete files, contracts, phases, risks, and validation.
5. Call \`get-plan-feedback\` before implementation, after review, after a long
   pause, and before the final response. Apply changes with \`update-visual-plan\`,
   preferring \`contentPatches\` for one frame, annotation, node, tab, or block. When the user
   wants source-control friendly edits, use \`patch-visual-plan-source\` against
   the MDX files instead of regenerating the plan.

## Agent Handoff

After the canvas and document, add a short handoff that names the chosen UI
direction, unresolved visual questions, and feedback that must be read before
code changes. Never claim feedback has been applied until \`get-plan-feedback\` or
the user has supplied it.

<!-- SHARED-CORE:wireframe-canvas START -->

## Wireframe & Canvas Core

This section is shared, word for word, by \`/visual-plan\`, \`/ui-plan\`, and
\`/visualize-plan\`. It is the single source of truth for how wireframes and the
canvas work. Do not paraphrase it per command.

**A wireframe is an HTML mockup. The renderer owns the look; you write the
content.** Set \`data.html\` to a self-contained, semantic HTML fragment of the
screen and set \`data.surface\`. The renderer owns the surface footprint/aspect,
the dark/light theme, the hand-drawn font, and the rough.js sketch overlay — you
never write \`<html>\`/\`<body>\`/\`<script>\`/\`<style>\` tags, font-family, hex colors,
or any width/height/coordinates. You write real HTML layout and real product
content; the renderer styles and roughens it.

**A wireframe block's data is an HTML screen plus a surface:**

\`\`\`json
{
  "surface": "browser",
  "html": "<div style=\\"display:flex;flex-direction:column;gap:10px;padding:16px;height:100%\\"><h1>Sign in</h1><p class=\\"wf-muted\\">Use your work email to continue.</p><div class=\\"wf-card\\" style=\\"display:flex;flex-direction:column;gap:10px\\"><label>Email<input value=\\"jane@acme.co\\" /></label><label>Password<input value=\\"••••••••\\" /></label><label style=\\"display:flex;align-items:center;gap:8px\\"><input type=\\"checkbox\\" checked /> Remember me</label><button class=\\"primary\\">Sign in</button></div><a href=\\"#\\">Forgot password?</a></div>"
}
\`\`\`

**Write PLAIN semantic HTML and let the renderer style it.** Bare elements
(\`h1\`/\`h2\`/\`h3\`, \`p\`, \`button\`, \`input\`, \`<input type="checkbox">\`, \`a\`, \`hr\`)
are auto-themed — no classes needed. Helper classes carry the rest:

- \`.wf-card\` / \`.wf-box\` — a bordered, padded container (a panel, a list item).
- \`.wf-pill\` / \`.wf-chip\` — a rounded tag or filter; add \`.accent\`
  (\`<span class="wf-pill accent">\`) for the accent-filled variant.
- \`.wf-muted\` — secondary/muted text (or use \`<small>\`).
- \`button.primary\` or any element with \`[data-primary]\` — the accent-filled
  primary button.

**Use the \`--wf-*\` tokens for any custom color, never hex.** The renderer flips
these on light/dark, so reading them is what keeps a mockup correct in both
themes. For any inline border, background, or text color, reference a token:
\`style="border:1.4px solid var(--wf-line)"\`. The tokens are \`--wf-ink\` (text),
\`--wf-muted\` (secondary text), \`--wf-line\` (borders/dividers), \`--wf-paper\`
(page background), \`--wf-card\` (raised surface), \`--wf-accent\` /
\`--wf-accent-fg\` / \`--wf-accent-soft\` (brand action), \`--wf-warn\`, \`--wf-ok\`,
and \`--wf-radius\`. Never hard-code a hex color and never set \`font-family\` — the
renderer owns the sketch/clean font.

**Lay out with inline \`style\` flex/grid.** You write the real layout —
\`display:flex; flex-direction:column; gap:10px; padding:16px\` and so on — and the
renderer never repositions anything. Compose the actual product: reproduce the
current screen, then show the modification. Real labels, real counts, real dates,
real button text grounded in the screen you read; not lorem or gray bars.

**Surface presets — match the real footprint, never default to desktop+mobile.**
Pick the \`surface\` that matches what the user will actually see:

- \`browser\`: a web page that needs a browser chrome frame around it.
- \`desktop\`: a full desktop app page or app shell.
- \`mobile\`: a phone screen, only when the work is genuinely mobile.
- \`popover\`: a small floating menu, dropdown, or inline popover.
- \`panel\`: a side panel, inspector, or sidebar widget.

The surface locks the footprint and aspect; never set width/height/coordinates.
A sidebar popover renders as a small surface, not a desktop page and a phone
frame. Do not emit \`desktop\` + \`mobile\` variants unless responsive behavior
actually changes the layout. For a component or widget, show one broader
app-context frame only when placement affects understanding, then the focused
component states.

**Modify, don't redesign.** When the task changes an existing screen, reproduce
the current screen's real layout and footprint FIRST, then change only the delta
and call it out with a single annotation. Do not restack the page into a new
layout. For net-new surfaces, compose from the real app shell.

**Zoom in on sub-surfaces, don't redraw the page.** For a small sub-surface (a
popover, menu, dialog, toast), show the full screen once, then add a small
separate artboard whose \`html\` contains ONLY that sub-surface — do not re-draw
the whole page around it, and do not scale a duplicate up. Pick the matching
\`surface\` (e.g. \`popover\`) so the footprint is right; never widen a popover to
page width.

**Loading / skeleton states.** Set \`data.skeleton: true\` on the wireframe and
fill the \`html\` with neutral, textless placeholder geometry — boxes and bars
built as \`<div>\`s with \`background:var(--wf-line)\` and explicit heights/widths,
no labels or copy. The renderer drops borders, sketch, and color into the
skeleton register automatically. Never escape to a \`custom-html\` document block
to fake a loader, and never move a mockup out of the canvas — mockups always
live in canvas artboards.

**Editing an existing mockup.** To change one element, text, or color in an
existing html mockup, do NOT regenerate the frame — call \`update-visual-plan\`
with \`contentPatches: [{ op: "patch-wireframe-html", blockId, edits: [{ find,
replace }] }]\`. Each \`find\` is a unique snippet of the current html (read it
first with \`get-visual-plan\`); set \`all: true\` on an edit to replace every
occurrence. The result is re-sanitized.

**Canvas annotations are designer notes on the artboard.** When a top canvas is
present, sprinkle Figma-style notes near the frames they explain: a short
heading, supporting text, and bullets — plain text layers, never bordered or
shadowed cards, and never a box around a frame. The renderer spaces notes away
from frames, so place each note by the frame it describes. Use an arrow only to
point at one specific control or transition; for a broad frame-level note, write
text beside the frame with no connector. Connectors are for real sequences only —
never fake "Step 1 → Step 2" lines between independent states.

**Do not create overlapping annotations.** Anchor each note to the frame it
explains with \`targetId\` + \`placement\` (top/right/bottom/left). The renderer
parks notes in a gutter beside the frame and lays them out automatically — never
supply x/y or points for anchored notes; hand-placed coordinates fight the
auto-layout and cause the overlap you're trying to avoid. Reserve arrows for a
note that must point at a specific control inside a frame; a note that simply
sits beside its frame needs no arrow.

**Patching.** Edit one wireframe, canvas annotation, or block with targeted \`contentPatches\`
(for example \`update-block\`, \`replace-blocks\`, \`update-canvas-annotation\`) rather
than regenerating the whole plan. \`contentPatches\` are part of the public MCP
action schema, so Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, and other hosts can make surgical
edits. If an agent is working from exported source files, use
\`read-visual-plan-source\` / \`patch-visual-plan-source\`: \`plan.mdx\` holds
frontmatter plus markdown/document blocks, \`canvas.mdx\` holds
\`<DesignBoard>/<Section>/<Artboard>/<Screen>/<Annotation>/<Connector>\`, and the
patch action normalizes the MDX back into the same JSON runtime model. JSON is
the canonical runtime shape; MDX is the repo-friendly authoring/export surface.
In the browser, humans edit \`rich-text\` prose inline; agents should still use
\`update-rich-text\` content patches or source patches for prose, and use
comments/structured patches for canvas, artboard, wireframe, and diagram edits.

**Never emit a titled artboard with no interior wireframe content.** Every artboard you place on the canvas must carry an \`html\` wireframe (or reference a wireframe block via \`blockId\`) — a label-only frame renders as an empty dashed box and is rejected at parse time. If you only have a title, write it as a section header or annotation, not an empty artboard.

**Fill the frame; keep labels short.** Each artboard is a fixed-size surface — compose enough realistic HTML to fill it top to bottom with even vertical rhythm; never leave a large empty band. On desktop/app-shell sidebars, let the nav stack flex to fill (\`flex:1\`) and add any persistent bottom action/status after it so the rail reads complete in taller frames. On mobile especially, flow real rows down the whole screen (status bar, header, then list/detail content) rather than a header floating above a gap. Keep every label short enough to sit on one line within its column — shorten the copy rather than relying on the frame to absorb it (long labels wrap or clip).

**Good example — a contacts list, surface \`browser\`.** A small, real screen
composed from the helper classes and tokens, layout in inline flex, no fonts or
hex colors:

\`\`\`html
<div style="display:flex;flex-direction:column;gap:12px;padding:16px;height:100%">
  <div style="display:flex;align-items:center;justify-content:space-between">
    <h1>Contacts</h1>
    <button class="primary">New contact</button>
  </div>
  <div style="display:flex;gap:6px">
    <span class="wf-pill accent">All 128</span>
    <span class="wf-pill">Favorites</span>
    <span class="wf-pill">Archived</span>
  </div>
  <div class="wf-card" style="display:flex;flex-direction:column;gap:0;padding:0">
    <div style="display:flex;align-items:center;gap:10px;padding:10px 12px;border-bottom:1.4px solid var(--wf-line)">
      <div style="width:32px;height:32px;border-radius:999px;background:var(--wf-accent-soft)"></div>
      <div style="flex:1"><strong>Jane Cooper</strong><br /><small>jane@acme.co</small></div>
      <span class="wf-pill">Lead</span>
    </div>
    <div style="display:flex;align-items:center;gap:10px;padding:10px 12px">
      <div style="width:32px;height:32px;border-radius:999px;background:var(--wf-accent-soft)"></div>
      <div style="flex:1"><strong>Marcus Lee</strong><br /><small>marcus@globex.io</small></div>
      <span class="wf-pill">Customer</span>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
\`\`\`

**Mockups belong on the canvas.** When the user asks for a mockup, UI state,
loading state, prototype, layout, screen, or visual comparison, make the top
canvas the primary home for that visual. Document blocks can explain, compare,
or map implementation, but they should not host the primary mockup just because
\`custom-html\`, screenshots, or prose are easier to produce. If the canvas cannot
represent the requested fidelity, still keep a canvas artboard and call out or
extend the needed canvas renderer capability.

**Legacy kit tree.** Older plans set a \`screen\` array of \`{ el, ...props }\` kit
nodes instead of \`html\`; the renderer still accepts and displays it, but new
plans emit \`html\`. Do not author fresh kit-tree screens — write the HTML mockup
instead. Likewise, old or imported plans may carry coordinate-based regions or
free-float x/y on notes or artboards; those are legacy escape hatches the
renderer still shows but you must never produce. The \`surface\` drives the aspect
and footprint, the canvas auto-places artboards, and the gutter parks notes by
\`targetId\` + \`placement\`; never supply width, height, or coordinates for a new
plan.

## Document Quality Core

This section is shared, word for word, by \`/visual-plan\`, \`/ui-plan\`, and
\`/visualize-plan\`. It is the single source of truth for the document below the
canvas. Do not paraphrase it per command.

**The document is a serious technical plan, not marketing.** Write it the way a
strong Claude or Codex implementation plan reads: outcome-first, prose-first,
self-contained, and specific. State the objective and what "done" means, the
scope and non-goals, the proposed approach with the key decisions and their
rationale, ordered steps that name real files, symbols, actions, and data
shapes, the risks, and a closing verification step (tests, build, or a checkable
behavior). Replace vague prose with specifics; never ship a step like "make it
work." No hero art, gradients, logos, nav bars, slogans, value props, giant
landing-page headings, or marketing cards unless the user explicitly asks.

**Canvas and document never duplicate each other.** The UI story lives on the
canvas with on-canvas annotations; the document carries the technical depth the
canvas cannot show — concrete file/symbol maps, API and data contracts, code
snippets, migration or implementation phases, risks, and validation. Repeat a
wireframe in the document only for a genuinely new detail view or comparison.
Skip the canvas entirely for non-visual work and write a clean rich document.

**Use the right block, and make it carry substance.** For the authoritative,
machine-checked list of block types and their data schemas, call \`get-plan-blocks\`
— it returns the live registry vocabulary (type, MDX tag, placement, key fields)
so you never emit a block the editor cannot render or round-trip:

- \`rich-text\` for plan prose with real bold/italic/code/links and nested lists.
- \`implementation-map\` / \`code-tabs\` for the file map: file path, the
  symbols/components to touch, the reason, risk/coordination notes, and a
  concise syntax-highlighted snippet of the code shape — never the whole file,
  never a prose-only file list.
- \`decision\` for two or three option cards with consequences. These are static
  records; do not style them like clickable tabs or chips unless the renderer
  truly supports changing the selection.
- \`diagram\` for architecture, sequence, data-flow, dependency, or state
  relationships, only when it clarifies something real. Labels must not overlap
  nodes, connectors, or each other.
- \`tabs\` for multiple states, directions, or comparisons. A tab that reveals
  only prose usually means the plan is under-specified — include a relevant
  visual unless the tab is intentionally document-only.
- \`table\`, \`checklist\`, \`callout\` for scannable structure.

**Open questions are callouts, not buried prose.** Surface anything unresolved in
a dedicated open-questions / needs-clarification block. Never put a
questions/decisions wall inside the plan narrative.

**\`custom-html\` is a bounded escape hatch only** — a single complete fragment
inside a block, never \`html\`/\`head\`/\`body\`/\`script\` tags, never a generic
placeholder, density demo, or proof that custom HTML works. Prefer the native
blocks for normal plans. It may support supplemental demos or references, but it
is never the primary home for a requested mockup, UI state, or visual
comparison. If fidelity requires HTML/CSS, image capture, or real React/CSS, the
product fix is canvas support for that artifact type, not moving the mockup into
the document.

**Before handoff, open the plan and check it.** Fix overlap, excessive
whitespace, clipped fragments, misleading inactive controls, poor contrast, and
unreadable diagrams before asking for approval.

## Good vs. Bad Exemplar

**GOOD.** A \`/ui-plan\` for a todo app: a canvas with a \`desktop\` artboard whose
\`data.html\` is a real flex layout — a sidebar of links (\`Inbox 12\`, \`Today 4\`,
\`Done\`), a main column with an \`<h1>Today</h1>\`, accent \`.wf-pill\`s for the
filters, a muted section label \`OVERDUE\`, and \`.wf-card\` task rows carrying real
titles, due dates, and a primary \`button.primary\` — styled only through bare
elements, helper classes, and \`--wf-*\` tokens, so the renderer applies the
correct desktop footprint, theme, and one subtle whole-frame wobble. Plain-text
designer notes sit spaced off the frame, pointing only at the controls that need
explanation. Below it, a Claude/Codex-grade document: objective and
done-criteria, an \`implementation-map\` naming the real components and actions
with short highlighted snippets, a \`decision\` card weighing two real approaches,
and a validation step — none of it repeating the canvas. This is the bar.

**BAD.** A \`data.html\` with hard-coded hex colors, a \`font-family\`, or fixed
pixel width/height; gray placeholder bars "insinuating" text on a non-skeleton
frame; a forced desktop + mobile pair for a popover; floating bordered
annotation cards hugging the frames; a fresh hand-authored kit-tree \`screen\`
instead of \`html\`; a mockup escaped into a document \`custom-html\` block; and a
marketing-style document with a hero heading and value props that just restates
what the canvas already shows. Never produce this.

There are two ways into Plans.

**Coding agent (CLI).** Install once with the Agent-Native CLI. The command
installs the Plans skills, registers the hosted Plans MCP connector, and
authenticates it in the same step (a one-time browser sign-in at setup — this is
intended), so the first tool call does not hit an OAuth wall:

\`\`\`bash
agent-native skills add visual-plan
\`\`\`

After that, \`/visual-plan\` (and \`/ui-plan\`, \`/visual-questions\`,
\`/visualize-plan\`) generate a plan and open the editor. Pass \`--no-connect\` to
register the connector without authenticating, then run
\`agent-native connect https://plan.agent-native.com\` whenever you are ready.

**Browser (people you share with).** Open the Plans editor and create & edit
with no sign-up — you work as a guest. Sign in only when you want to save or
share; signing in claims the plans you made as a guest into your account.

Sharing and commenting require an account: public/shared plans are viewable by
anyone with the link, but commenting on them needs an agent-native account.

For fully offline, no-account use, run the Plans app locally and sync plans to
your repo as MDX. This local mode is a separate advanced path, not the default
hosted flow.

If a Plans tool returns \`needs auth\`, \`Unauthorized\`, or \`Session terminated\`,
do not keep retrying the tool. Authenticate the connector with
\`agent-native connect https://plan.agent-native.com\` (OAuth-capable hosts can
instead re-run /mcp and choose Authenticate), then continue once the connector
is available.

Hosted default: connect \`https://plan.agent-native.com/_agent-native/mcp\`. Do
not put shared secrets in skill files.

  Use Agent-Native Plans to ask rich visual intake questions when
  /visual-questions is explicitly requested before creating a UI plan or visual
  plan.
metadata:
  visibility: both
---

# Visual Questions

Use \`/visual-questions\` when the next best step is not a plan yet, but a
reviewable visual intake: single-choice chips, multi-select chips, freeform
notes, mockup choices, sketch diagrams, and a generated answer summary that feeds
the next planning prompt. It composes with \`/visual-plan\`, \`/ui-plan\`, and
\`/visualize-plan\`.

## When To Use

- The user asks to be shown options before the agent writes a plan.
- UI direction, form factor, layout model, feature set, or visual style is fuzzy
  enough that 2-6 answers would materially change the plan.
- The user would benefit from choosing between visual mockups or diagrams rather
  than answering text-only prompts.

Gate hard: skip this for tiny, unambiguous changes. If the agent can reasonably
infer the answer, prefer \`/ui-plan\` or \`/visual-plan\` directly and put
assumptions in the plan.

Visual questions are an explicit intake command, not an automatic preflight for
\`/visual-plan\` or \`/ui-plan\`.

## Workflow

1. Call \`create-visual-questions\` with a clear title, brief, source, and repo
   path when known.
2. Omit \`questions\` for the default UI intake. Provide a custom \`questions\` array
   only when the task has domain-specific choices.
3. Surface the returned Plans link and ask the user to answer visually.
4. The generated summary drives the next step: \`create-ui-plan\` for UI flows,
   \`create-visual-plan\` for general plans, \`visualize-plan\` when a text plan
   already exists, or \`update-visual-plan\` with targeted \`contentPatches\` to fold
   answers into an active plan.
5. If the user leaves comments, call \`get-plan-feedback\` before using the answers.

## Question Types

Supported \`questions\` entries:

- \`single\`: chip group where one option wins.
- \`multi\`: chip group where multiple options can be selected.
- \`freeform\`: textarea for constraints, inspirations, or things to avoid.
- \`visual\`: visual options with sketch previews — use for layout direction, flow
  depth, surface choice, or diagram choices.

Each option can include \`label\`, \`value\`, \`description\`, \`recommended\`,
\`preview\`, and \`bullets\`. Valid \`preview\` values match the wireframe surfaces:
\`desktop\`, \`mobile\`, \`popover\`, \`panel\`, \`component\`, \`split\`, \`flow\`, and
\`diagram\`. Pick the preview that matches the real footprint — do not offer a
desktop/mobile pair for a popover, panel, or component.

## Quality Bar

- Ask only decision-changing questions. A beautiful form with low-value questions
  is still friction.
- Prefer visible, answerable options over abstract prose.
- Use visual tabs when users need to compare layout or flow shapes.
- Keep the output calm and document-like, not a landing page.
- The generated answer summary is not the final plan; it is the intake prompt for
  the next agent step.

## Tool Guidance

- \`create-visual-questions\`: create the interactive intake plan.
- \`get-visual-plan\`: inspect the current visual question plan.
- \`get-plan-feedback\`: read comments before creating or updating the next plan.
- \`create-ui-plan\`: create a UI-first plan from the answers.
- \`create-visual-plan\`: create a general visual plan from the answers.
- \`visualize-plan\`: enrich an existing text plan after answers are gathered.
- \`export-visual-plan\`: export answer plans as HTML, Markdown fallback,
  structured JSON, and MDX files when the intake needs to be checked into a repo.
- \`read-visual-plan-source\` / \`patch-visual-plan-source\`: inspect or patch the
  MDX source if another agent is operating from checked-in plan files.

## Setup & Authentication

There are two ways into Plans.

  Convert an existing Codex, Claude Code, Markdown, or pasted plan into an
  Agent-Native Plans visual companion with diagrams, wireframes, annotations, and
  feedback.
metadata:
  visibility: exported
---

# Visualize Plan

Use \`/visualize-plan\` when a plan already exists and the user wants it easier to
review. The native Codex or Claude Code plan can stay where it is; Agent-Native
Plans creates a structured visual companion beside it — diagrams, wireframes,
state sketches, option cards, and comment prompts instead of a wall of text. It
still reads like a plan, not a marketing page.

## Plan Discipline

- **Gate hard.** A visual companion is worth it only when the source plan is
  long, risky, or hard to react to as text. If the source plan is for trivial,
  unambiguous work, skip the companion and just implement.
- **Stay grounded and read-only.** Preserve the source plan's intent, do not
  invent codebase facts, and label anything inferred as inferred. Make no source
  edits while building or reviewing the companion.
- **The companion is the approval gate.** Ask the user to review and approve the
  direction before you write code, and name which files/areas the work touches.
  Carry unresolved assumptions and open questions into a clear block instead of
  guessing silently.

## Workflow

1. Gather the existing plan text from the user's paste, a referenced file, or
   recent visible agent context. Do not invent the source plan. If no plan text
   exists and the work is UI-heavy, use \`/ui-plan\` instead.
2. Call \`visualize-plan\` with \`planText\`, \`title\`, \`brief\`, \`source\`, and
   \`repoPath\` when available.
3. Surface the returned Plans link or inline MCP App.
4. Enrich the import with \`update-visual-plan\` (prefer targeted \`contentPatches\`):
   add a canvas with wireframes for user-visible UI, diagrams for architecture or
   data flow, option cards for real tradeoffs, and explicit open questions. Apply
   the two cores below — the companion must meet the same quality bar as a fresh
   plan, not be a thinner ruleset. Label inferred visuals as inferred. When the
   user wants source-control friendly edits, use \`patch-visual-plan-source\`
   against the MDX files instead of regenerating the plan.
5. Ask the user to react, then call \`get-plan-feedback\` before implementing,
   after review, and before the final response.
6. Treat imported text as source material. The structured visual plan and
   comments are the review surface; HTML is the export receipt. Do not replace a
   native plan unless the user asks.

<!-- SHARED-CORE:wireframe-canvas START -->

## Wireframe & Canvas Core

This section is shared, word for word, by \`/visual-plan\`, \`/ui-plan\`, and
\`/visualize-plan\`. It is the single source of truth for how wireframes and the
canvas work. Do not paraphrase it per command.

**A wireframe is an HTML mockup. The renderer owns the look; you write the
content.** Set \`data.html\` to a self-contained, semantic HTML fragment of the
screen and set \`data.surface\`. The renderer owns the surface footprint/aspect,
the dark/light theme, the hand-drawn font, and the rough.js sketch overlay — you
never write \`<html>\`/\`<body>\`/\`<script>\`/\`<style>\` tags, font-family, hex colors,
or any width/height/coordinates. You write real HTML layout and real product
content; the renderer styles and roughens it.

**A wireframe block's data is an HTML screen plus a surface:**

\`\`\`json
{
  "surface": "browser",
  "html": "<div style=\\"display:flex;flex-direction:column;gap:10px;padding:16px;height:100%\\"><h1>Sign in</h1><p class=\\"wf-muted\\">Use your work email to continue.</p><div class=\\"wf-card\\" style=\\"display:flex;flex-direction:column;gap:10px\\"><label>Email<input value=\\"jane@acme.co\\" /></label><label>Password<input value=\\"••••••••\\" /></label><label style=\\"display:flex;align-items:center;gap:8px\\"><input type=\\"checkbox\\" checked /> Remember me</label><button class=\\"primary\\">Sign in</button></div><a href=\\"#\\">Forgot password?</a></div>"
}
\`\`\`

**Write PLAIN semantic HTML and let the renderer style it.** Bare elements
(\`h1\`/\`h2\`/\`h3\`, \`p\`, \`button\`, \`input\`, \`<input type="checkbox">\`, \`a\`, \`hr\`)
are auto-themed — no classes needed. Helper classes carry the rest:

- \`.wf-card\` / \`.wf-box\` — a bordered, padded container (a panel, a list item).
- \`.wf-pill\` / \`.wf-chip\` — a rounded tag or filter; add \`.accent\`
  (\`<span class="wf-pill accent">\`) for the accent-filled variant.
- \`.wf-muted\` — secondary/muted text (or use \`<small>\`).
- \`button.primary\` or any element with \`[data-primary]\` — the accent-filled
  primary button.

**Use the \`--wf-*\` tokens for any custom color, never hex.** The renderer flips
these on light/dark, so reading them is what keeps a mockup correct in both
themes. For any inline border, background, or text color, reference a token:
\`style="border:1.4px solid var(--wf-line)"\`. The tokens are \`--wf-ink\` (text),
\`--wf-muted\` (secondary text), \`--wf-line\` (borders/dividers), \`--wf-paper\`
(page background), \`--wf-card\` (raised surface), \`--wf-accent\` /
\`--wf-accent-fg\` / \`--wf-accent-soft\` (brand action), \`--wf-warn\`, \`--wf-ok\`,
and \`--wf-radius\`. Never hard-code a hex color and never set \`font-family\` — the
renderer owns the sketch/clean font.

**Lay out with inline \`style\` flex/grid.** You write the real layout —
\`display:flex; flex-direction:column; gap:10px; padding:16px\` and so on — and the
renderer never repositions anything. Compose the actual product: reproduce the
current screen, then show the modification. Real labels, real counts, real dates,
real button text grounded in the screen you read; not lorem or gray bars.

**Surface presets — match the real footprint, never default to desktop+mobile.**
Pick the \`surface\` that matches what the user will actually see:

- \`browser\`: a web page that needs a browser chrome frame around it.
- \`desktop\`: a full desktop app page or app shell.
- \`mobile\`: a phone screen, only when the work is genuinely mobile.
- \`popover\`: a small floating menu, dropdown, or inline popover.
- \`panel\`: a side panel, inspector, or sidebar widget.

The surface locks the footprint and aspect; never set width/height/coordinates.
A sidebar popover renders as a small surface, not a desktop page and a phone
frame. Do not emit \`desktop\` + \`mobile\` variants unless responsive behavior
actually changes the layout. For a component or widget, show one broader
app-context frame only when placement affects understanding, then the focused
component states.

**Modify, don't redesign.** When the task changes an existing screen, reproduce
the current screen's real layout and footprint FIRST, then change only the delta
and call it out with a single annotation. Do not restack the page into a new
layout. For net-new surfaces, compose from the real app shell.

**Zoom in on sub-surfaces, don't redraw the page.** For a small sub-surface (a
popover, menu, dialog, toast), show the full screen once, then add a small
separate artboard whose \`html\` contains ONLY that sub-surface — do not re-draw
the whole page around it, and do not scale a duplicate up. Pick the matching
\`surface\` (e.g. \`popover\`) so the footprint is right; never widen a popover to
page width.

**Loading / skeleton states.** Set \`data.skeleton: true\` on the wireframe and
fill the \`html\` with neutral, textless placeholder geometry — boxes and bars
built as \`<div>\`s with \`background:var(--wf-line)\` and explicit heights/widths,
no labels or copy. The renderer drops borders, sketch, and color into the
skeleton register automatically. Never escape to a \`custom-html\` document block
to fake a loader, and never move a mockup out of the canvas — mockups always
live in canvas artboards.

**Editing an existing mockup.** To change one element, text, or color in an
existing html mockup, do NOT regenerate the frame — call \`update-visual-plan\`
with \`contentPatches: [{ op: "patch-wireframe-html", blockId, edits: [{ find,
replace }] }]\`. Each \`find\` is a unique snippet of the current html (read it
first with \`get-visual-plan\`); set \`all: true\` on an edit to replace every
occurrence. The result is re-sanitized.

**Canvas annotations are designer notes on the artboard.** When a top canvas is
present, sprinkle Figma-style notes near the frames they explain: a short
heading, supporting text, and bullets — plain text layers, never bordered or
shadowed cards, and never a box around a frame. The renderer spaces notes away
from frames, so place each note by the frame it describes. Use an arrow only to
point at one specific control or transition; for a broad frame-level note, write
text beside the frame with no connector. Connectors are for real sequences only —
never fake "Step 1 → Step 2" lines between independent states.

**Do not create overlapping annotations.** Anchor each note to the frame it
explains with \`targetId\` + \`placement\` (top/right/bottom/left). The renderer
parks notes in a gutter beside the frame and lays them out automatically — never
supply x/y or points for anchored notes; hand-placed coordinates fight the
auto-layout and cause the overlap you're trying to avoid. Reserve arrows for a
note that must point at a specific control inside a frame; a note that simply
sits beside its frame needs no arrow.

**Patching.** Edit one wireframe, canvas annotation, or block with targeted \`contentPatches\`
(for example \`update-block\`, \`replace-blocks\`, \`update-canvas-annotation\`) rather
than regenerating the whole plan. \`contentPatches\` are part of the public MCP
action schema, so Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, and other hosts can make surgical
edits. If an agent is working from exported source files, use
\`read-visual-plan-source\` / \`patch-visual-plan-source\`: \`plan.mdx\` holds
frontmatter plus markdown/document blocks, \`canvas.mdx\` holds
\`<DesignBoard>/<Section>/<Artboard>/<Screen>/<Annotation>/<Connector>\`, and the
patch action normalizes the MDX back into the same JSON runtime model. JSON is
the canonical runtime shape; MDX is the repo-friendly authoring/export surface.
In the browser, humans edit \`rich-text\` prose inline; agents should still use
\`update-rich-text\` content patches or source patches for prose, and use
comments/structured patches for canvas, artboard, wireframe, and diagram edits.

**Never emit a titled artboard with no interior wireframe content.** Every artboard you place on the canvas must carry an \`html\` wireframe (or reference a wireframe block via \`blockId\`) — a label-only frame renders as an empty dashed box and is rejected at parse time. If you only have a title, write it as a section header or annotation, not an empty artboard.

**Fill the frame; keep labels short.** Each artboard is a fixed-size surface — compose enough realistic HTML to fill it top to bottom with even vertical rhythm; never leave a large empty band. On desktop/app-shell sidebars, let the nav stack flex to fill (\`flex:1\`) and add any persistent bottom action/status after it so the rail reads complete in taller frames. On mobile especially, flow real rows down the whole screen (status bar, header, then list/detail content) rather than a header floating above a gap. Keep every label short enough to sit on one line within its column — shorten the copy rather than relying on the frame to absorb it (long labels wrap or clip).

**Good example — a contacts list, surface \`browser\`.** A small, real screen
composed from the helper classes and tokens, layout in inline flex, no fonts or
hex colors:

\`\`\`html
<div style="display:flex;flex-direction:column;gap:12px;padding:16px;height:100%">
  <div style="display:flex;align-items:center;justify-content:space-between">
    <h1>Contacts</h1>
    <button class="primary">New contact</button>
  </div>
  <div style="display:flex;gap:6px">
    <span class="wf-pill accent">All 128</span>
    <span class="wf-pill">Favorites</span>
    <span class="wf-pill">Archived</span>
  </div>
  <div class="wf-card" style="display:flex;flex-direction:column;gap:0;padding:0">
    <div style="display:flex;align-items:center;gap:10px;padding:10px 12px;border-bottom:1.4px solid var(--wf-line)">
      <div style="width:32px;height:32px;border-radius:999px;background:var(--wf-accent-soft)"></div>
      <div style="flex:1"><strong>Jane Cooper</strong><br /><small>jane@acme.co</small></div>
      <span class="wf-pill">Lead</span>
    </div>
    <div style="display:flex;align-items:center;gap:10px;padding:10px 12px">
      <div style="width:32px;height:32px;border-radius:999px;background:var(--wf-accent-soft)"></div>
      <div style="flex:1"><strong>Marcus Lee</strong><br /><small>marcus@globex.io</small></div>
      <span class="wf-pill">Customer</span>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
\`\`\`

**Mockups belong on the canvas.** When the user asks for a mockup, UI state,
loading state, prototype, layout, screen, or visual comparison, make the top
canvas the primary home for that visual. Document blocks can explain, compare,
or map implementation, but they should not host the primary mockup just because
\`custom-html\`, screenshots, or prose are easier to produce. If the canvas cannot
represent the requested fidelity, still keep a canvas artboard and call out or
extend the needed canvas renderer capability.

**Legacy kit tree.** Older plans set a \`screen\` array of \`{ el, ...props }\` kit
nodes instead of \`html\`; the renderer still accepts and displays it, but new
plans emit \`html\`. Do not author fresh kit-tree screens — write the HTML mockup
instead. Likewise, old or imported plans may carry coordinate-based regions or
free-float x/y on notes or artboards; those are legacy escape hatches the
renderer still shows but you must never produce. The \`surface\` drives the aspect
and footprint, the canvas auto-places artboards, and the gutter parks notes by
\`targetId\` + \`placement\`; never supply width, height, or coordinates for a new
plan.

<!-- SHARED-CORE:wireframe-canvas END -->

<!-- SHARED-CORE:document-quality START -->

## Document Quality Core

This section is shared, word for word, by \`/visual-plan\`, \`/ui-plan\`, and
\`/visualize-plan\`. It is the single source of truth for the document below the
canvas. Do not paraphrase it per command.

**The document is a serious technical plan, not marketing.** Write it the way a
strong Claude or Codex implementation plan reads: outcome-first, prose-first,
self-contained, and specific. State the objective and what "done" means, the
scope and non-goals, the proposed approach with the key decisions and their
rationale, ordered steps that name real files, symbols, actions, and data
shapes, the risks, and a closing verification step (tests, build, or a checkable
behavior). Replace vague prose with specifics; never ship a step like "make it
work." No hero art, gradients, logos, nav bars, slogans, value props, giant
landing-page headings, or marketing cards unless the user explicitly asks.

**Canvas and document never duplicate each other.** The UI story lives on the
canvas with on-canvas annotations; the document carries the technical depth the
canvas cannot show — concrete file/symbol maps, API and data contracts, code
snippets, migration or implementation phases, risks, and validation. Repeat a
wireframe in the document only for a genuinely new detail view or comparison.
Skip the canvas entirely for non-visual work and write a clean rich document.

**Use the right block, and make it carry substance.** For the authoritative,
machine-checked list of block types and their data schemas, call \`get-plan-blocks\`
— it returns the live registry vocabulary (type, MDX tag, placement, key fields)
so you never emit a block the editor cannot render or round-trip:

- \`rich-text\` for plan prose with real bold/italic/code/links and nested lists.
- \`implementation-map\` / \`code-tabs\` for the file map: file path, the
  symbols/components to touch, the reason, risk/coordination notes, and a
  concise syntax-highlighted snippet of the code shape — never the whole file,
  never a prose-only file list.
- \`decision\` for two or three option cards with consequences. These are static
  records; do not style them like clickable tabs or chips unless the renderer
  truly supports changing the selection.
- \`diagram\` for architecture, sequence, data-flow, dependency, or state
  relationships, only when it clarifies something real. Labels must not overlap
  nodes, connectors, or each other.
- \`tabs\` for multiple states, directions, or comparisons. A tab that reveals
  only prose usually means the plan is under-specified — include a relevant
  visual unless the tab is intentionally document-only.
- \`table\`, \`checklist\`, \`callout\` for scannable structure.

**Open questions are callouts, not buried prose.** Surface anything unresolved in
a dedicated open-questions / needs-clarification block. Never put a
questions/decisions wall inside the plan narrative.

**\`custom-html\` is a bounded escape hatch only** — a single complete fragment
inside a block, never \`html\`/\`head\`/\`body\`/\`script\` tags, never a generic
placeholder, density demo, or proof that custom HTML works. Prefer the native
blocks for normal plans. It may support supplemental demos or references, but it
is never the primary home for a requested mockup, UI state, or visual
comparison. If fidelity requires HTML/CSS, image capture, or real React/CSS, the
product fix is canvas support for that artifact type, not moving the mockup into
the document.

**Before handoff, open the plan and check it.** Fix overlap, excessive
whitespace, clipped fragments, misleading inactive controls, poor contrast, and
unreadable diagrams before asking for approval.

<!-- SHARED-CORE:document-quality END -->

<!-- SHARED-CORE:exemplar START -->

## Good vs. Bad Exemplar

**GOOD.** A \`/ui-plan\` for a todo app: a canvas with a \`desktop\` artboard whose
\`data.html\` is a real flex layout — a sidebar of links (\`Inbox 12\`, \`Today 4\`,
\`Done\`), a main column with an \`<h1>Today</h1>\`, accent \`.wf-pill\`s for the
filters, a muted section label \`OVERDUE\`, and \`.wf-card\` task rows carrying real
titles, due dates, and a primary \`button.primary\` — styled only through bare
elements, helper classes, and \`--wf-*\` tokens, so the renderer applies the
correct desktop footprint, theme, and one subtle whole-frame wobble. Plain-text
designer notes sit spaced off the frame, pointing only at the controls that need
explanation. Below it, a Claude/Codex-grade document: objective and
done-criteria, an \`implementation-map\` naming the real components and actions
with short highlighted snippets, a \`decision\` card weighing two real approaches,
and a validation step — none of it repeating the canvas. This is the bar.

**BAD.** A \`data.html\` with hard-coded hex colors, a \`font-family\`, or fixed
pixel width/height; gray placeholder bars "insinuating" text on a non-skeleton
frame; a forced desktop + mobile pair for a popover; floating bordered
annotation cards hugging the frames; a fresh hand-authored kit-tree \`screen\`
instead of \`html\`; a mockup escaped into a document \`custom-html\` block; and a
marketing-style document with a hero heading and value props that just restates
what the canvas already shows. Never produce this.

<!-- SHARED-CORE:exemplar END -->

## Tool Guidance

- \`visualize-plan\`: create the visual companion from the existing text plan.
- \`update-visual-plan\`: enrich the import; prefer targeted \`contentPatches\` over
  replacing the whole content.
- \`read-visual-plan-source\`: read the normalized plan as \`plan.mdx\`,
  optional \`canvas.mdx\`, optional \`.plan-state.json\`, and JSON.
- \`patch-visual-plan-source\`: apply granular MDX AST patches by stable block,
  artboard, annotation, component, or wireframe-node id.
- \`import-visual-plan-source\`: create or replace a plan from an MDX folder.
- \`get-visual-plan\`: inspect the current structured plan, exported HTML, and
  annotations; it also returns the MDX folder for source workflows.
- \`get-plan-feedback\`: read unconsumed reviewer comments before coding.
- \`export-visual-plan\`: export HTML, Markdown fallback, structured JSON, and MDX
  files for repo check-in.

When the user critiques a plan's look or structure, fix the renderer or this
skill — never hand-edit one stored plan. Turn feedback into better guidance.

## Setup & Authentication

There are two ways into Plans.

**Coding agent (CLI).** Install once with the Agent-Native CLI. The command
installs the Plans skills, registers the hosted Plans MCP connector, and
authenticates it in the same step (a one-time browser sign-in at setup — this is
intended), so the first tool call does not hit an OAuth wall:

\`\`\`bash
agent-native skills add visual-plan
\`\`\`

After that, \`/visual-plan\` (and \`/ui-plan\`, \`/visual-questions\`,
\`/visualize-plan\`) generate a plan and open the editor. Pass \`--no-connect\` to
register the connector without authenticating, then run
\`agent-native connect https://plan.agent-native.com\` whenever you are ready.

**Browser (people you share with).** Open the Plans editor and create & edit
with no sign-up — you work as a guest. Sign in only when you want to save or
share; signing in claims the plans you made as a guest into your account.

Sharing and commenting require an account: public/shared plans are viewable by
anyone with the link, but commenting on them needs an agent-native account.

For fully offline, no-account use, run the Plans app locally and sync plans to
your repo as MDX. This local mode is a separate advanced path, not the default
hosted flow.

If a Plans tool returns \`needs auth\`, \`Unauthorized\`, or \`Session terminated\`,
do not keep retrying the tool. Authenticate the connector with
\`agent-native connect https://plan.agent-native.com\` (OAuth-capable hosts can
instead re-run /mcp and choose Authenticate), then continue once the connector
is available.

Hosted default: connect \`https://plan.agent-native.com/_agent-native/mcp\`. Do
not put shared secrets in skill files.
