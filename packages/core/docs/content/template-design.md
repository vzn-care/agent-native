# Design

Design is an agent-native HTML prototyping studio. Instead of a layered drawing canvas, the agent generates complete self-contained Alpine/Tailwind HTML prototypes, renders them in an iframe, and lets you refine the result with prompts and tweak controls.

Use it when you want a polished landing page concept, product UI direction, brand exploration, or interactive prototype that can leave the tool as real HTML.

## What you can do with it

- **Generate complete prototypes.** Describe the screen or page you need and the agent creates a working HTML document with Tailwind styling and Alpine interactions.
- **Compare variants.** Start with multiple directions, pick the strongest one, then continue refining.
- **Tweak visually.** Use the built-in tweak controls for common changes, or ask the agent for copy, layout, color, spacing, and interaction updates.
- **Apply design systems.** Save and reuse design-system preferences so generated work stays closer to your brand.
- **Import references.** Bring in existing HTML or reference material as context for a new design pass.
- **Export real files.** Export HTML, ZIP, or PDF from the generated prototype.

## Getting started

Live demo: [design.agent-native.com](https://design.agent-native.com).

1. **Describe the artifact.** Ask for the screen, flow, landing page, or visual
   direction you want. Include audience, tone, and any product constraints.
2. **Compare directions.** Generate a few variants, pick the strongest one, and
   keep refining instead of starting over.
3. **Tune the details.** Use tweak controls for common visual changes, or ask
   the agent for layout, copy, responsive, and interaction changes.
4. **Export when it is useful.** Download HTML, ZIP, or PDF once the prototype
   is ready to hand to another tool or teammate.

### Useful prompts

- "Create three landing-page directions for a technical analytics product."
- "Make this dashboard denser and easier to scan for an operations team."
- "Apply our saved design system and simplify the mobile layout."
- "Export this prototype as a ZIP once the final variant is selected."
- "Turn this HTML into a stronger pricing page without changing the brand colors."

## For developers

The rest of this doc is for anyone forking the Design template or extending it.

### Scaffolding

```bash
npx @agent-native/core@latest create my-design --standalone --template design
```

### Data model

All data lives in SQL via Drizzle ORM. Schema: `templates/design/server/db/schema.ts`. Designs and design systems carry the standard `ownableColumns` and a matching framework shares table, so they slot into the per-user / per-org sharing model.

| Table                                    | What it holds                                                                                                                                    |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `designs`                                | A design project — `title`, `description`, `project_type` (`prototype` / `other`), the `data` JSON blob, and an optional `design_system_id` link |
| `design_files`                           | Individual files belonging to a design (`filename`, `content`, `file_type` defaulting to `html`)                                                 |
| `design_versions`                        | Point-in-time `snapshot`s of a design with an optional `label`, for history and rollback                                                         |
| `design_systems`                         | Reusable brand tokens — `data` (colors/typography/spacing), `assets`, `custom_instructions`, and an `is_default` flag                            |
| `design_shares` / `design_system_shares` | Framework shares tables mapping principals (users or orgs) to roles (viewer, editor, admin)                                                      |

A design project is a shell until it has content: `create-design` makes an empty row (`data: "{}"`), then `generate-design` writes the actual standalone HTML/JSX files. The generated artifact, the editable source, and every export all come from the same HTML, so there is no separate "AI mockup" format to translate. A linked design system supplies tokens and `custom_instructions` that the agent honors on every generation pass.

Routes in the UI live under `templates/design/app/routes/`: `_index.tsx` (list), `design.$id.tsx` (editor), `present.$id.tsx` (presentation), `design-systems.tsx` and `design-systems_.setup.tsx`, `templates.tsx`, `examples.tsx`, plus `settings.tsx` and `team.tsx`.

### Key actions

Every agent-callable operation is a TypeScript file in `templates/design/actions/`, auto-mounted at `POST /_agent-native/actions/:name` and runnable from the CLI as `pnpm action <name>`. The groupings:

- **Designs** — `create-design` (empty shell), `generate-design` (write generated HTML/JSX content), `update-design`, `get-design`, `list-designs`, `duplicate-design`, `delete-design`, and `apply-tweaks` for persisting live tweak-knob values (accent color, density, etc.).
- **Files** — `create-file`, `update-file`, `list-files`, `delete-file` for the files inside a design project.
- **Design systems** — `create-design-system`, `update-design-system`, `get-design-system`, `list-design-systems`, `delete-design-system`, `set-default-design-system`, and `analyze-brand-assets` for gathering brand data ahead of analysis.
- **Import** — `import-code`, `import-figma`, `import-github`, `import-from-url`, `import-document` (DOCX/PPTX/PDF/XLSX), and `import-design-project` to lift a design system out of an existing project.
- **Export & handoff** — `export-html`, `export-pdf`, `export-svg`, `export-zip`, and `export-coding-handoff` to turn a design into a coding-tool handoff.
- **Context & navigation** — `view-screen` (current design, open file, view, pending question or variant grid), `get-design-snapshot` (current state for an external agent to continue from), and `navigate`.

### Customizing it

Design is a complete, cloneable template. Some practical extension ideas:

- "Add a reusable ecommerce design system with our tokens and sample components."
- "Add an export step that uploads the ZIP to our internal review system."
- "Let me paste existing landing-page HTML and ask the agent for three stronger versions."
- "Add a saved prompt library for product-page, dashboard, and onboarding-screen briefs."
- "Add a custom PDF export preset for stakeholder review."

The agent edits routes, components, actions, and SQL-backed models as needed. See [Templates](/docs/cloneable-saas) for the full clone, customize, deploy flow, and [Getting Started](/docs/getting-started) if this is your first agent-native template.
