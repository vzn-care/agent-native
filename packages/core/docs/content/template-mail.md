# Mail

An agent-powered email client. Connect your Gmail account and the agent can read, draft, send, and organize email for you — alongside a fast, keyboard-first inbox you can drive yourself. Think Superhuman, but the agent is a first-class citizen and the codebase is yours to own.

When you open the app, you'll see your inbox on the left, the open thread in the middle, and the agent in the sidebar on the right. The agent always knows which view you're in and which thread you have open, so you can say "archive this" or "draft a friendly decline" without explaining what "this" is.

## What you can do with it

- **Read and triage email** with keyboard shortcuts (`J`/`K` to move, `E` to archive, `R` to reply, `C` to compose).
- **Connect multiple Gmail accounts** — personal and work in one inbox.
- **Ask the agent to do anything you can do.** "Summarize my unread emails." "Draft a reply that politely declines." "Archive all Netlify bot emails older than a week."
- **Queue drafts for review.** Teammates and Slack users can ask the agent to prepare an email for an org member; the owner reviews, edits, and sends it from Mail.
- **Auto-triage with rules.** Set up automation rules in plain English ("from a newsletter") with actions (label, archive, mark read, star, trash).
- **Track opens and clicks** on the emails you send.
- **Search across every connected inbox** with one query.
- **Bulk archive, export, and label** — useful for inbox cleanup.

## Getting started

Live demo: [mail.agent-native.com](https://mail.agent-native.com).

> **Google may show a warning:** The hosted demo uses Agent-Native's shared Google app for Gmail access, so Google may ask you to confirm before continuing. Run locally to use your own Google OAuth client.

When you first open the app:

1. Click **Settings** in the sidebar.
2. Click **Connect Google account**, sign in to Gmail, and approve.
3. (Optional) Connect a second Google account for work + personal.
4. Head back to the inbox — your real Gmail will sync in.

Without a Google account connected, the app runs against an empty local mailbox (useful for screenshots and demos, not much else).

## Talking to the agent

The agent reads `application_state.navigation` on every turn, so it already knows which view you're in, which thread is open, and which message is focused — you don't have to tell it. You can just say things like:

- "Summarize my unread emails."
- "Find the latest thread from Alice about the budget."
- "Draft a reply that politely declines."
- "Archive all Netlify bot emails older than a week."
- "Open my starred emails."
- "Make this draft more formal."
- "Did they open my email?"

If you select text and hit Cmd+I, that selection travels with your next message — so "make this punchier" operates on exactly what you highlighted.

## For developers

The rest of this doc is for anyone forking the Mail template or extending it.

### Quick start

Create a new workspace with the Mail template:

```bash
npx @agent-native/core@latest create my-mail --standalone --template mail
cd my-mail
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Or add Mail to an existing agent-native workspace:

```bash
npx @agent-native/core@latest add-app
```

To connect Gmail in dev, you need a Google OAuth client:

1. Open [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) and create a project.
2. Enable the **Gmail API** under APIs & Services → Library.
3. Create OAuth 2.0 credentials (type: Web application). Add `http://localhost:8085/_agent-native/google/callback` as an authorized redirect URI.
4. Copy the Client ID and Client Secret into the Settings page of the running app, then click **Connect Google account**.

Tokens are stored in the `oauth_tokens` SQL table and refresh automatically. You can connect multiple Gmail accounts once the first is set up.

### Key features (technical)

**Gmail sync (multi-account).** Connect one or many Google accounts via OAuth. List and search actions query all connected inboxes by default; results carry an `accountEmail` field so you can tell which inbox each thread came from. Scope to a single account with `--account=user@example.com`. OAuth tokens are stored via `@agent-native/core/oauth-tokens` under the `"google"` provider.

**Multiple compose drafts.** The compose panel supports multiple draft tabs at once. Each draft is stored as an `application_state` entry at `compose-{id}` and syncs live between the agent and the UI. The agent can create a new draft with `manage-draft --action=create`, edit your in-progress draft with `--action=update`, or close tabs with `--action=delete`. Drafts use markdown in the body field; the TipTap editor renders it as rich text and converts to HTML on send.

**Queued draft review.** Drafts requested by teammates or Slack are durable SQL rows in `queued_email_drafts`. The agent uses `queue-email-draft` to assign a draft to an org member, returns a review URL such as `/draft-queue/<id>`, and waits for the owner to review or explicitly send. The queue supports listing assigned drafts, editing them, opening one in the compose panel, dismissing it, and sending one or all reviewed drafts.

**AI triage via automations.** Mail supports automation rules that run against new inbox email using AI. A rule has a natural-language condition (for example, `"from a newsletter"` or `"subject contains invoice"`) and a list of actions (`label`, `archive`, `mark_read`, `star`, `trash`). Manage them via `pnpm action manage-automations --action=create|list|update|delete|enable|disable`, or through the Settings page. Rules fire automatically and can be triggered manually with `pnpm action trigger-automations`.

**Send tracking.** Sent messages get open-pixel and link-click tracking injected automatically. Settings live under `mail-settings.tracking` with `tracking.opens` and `tracking.clicks` (both default `true`). Only links in the new portion of a reply or forward are rewritten — quoted content is left alone. Pull stats for any sent message with `pnpm action get-tracking --id=<message-id>`, or from `GET /api/emails/:id/tracking`. Open and click events are stored in the `email_tracking` and `email_link_tracking` tables.

**Search.** `pnpm action search-emails --q=<term>` searches across all views and all connected accounts. The UI search bar maps to the same action. Both `search-emails` and `list-emails` take `--compact` for shorter output and `--fields=from,subject,date` to limit returned fields.

**Bulk operations and export.**

- `pnpm action bulk-archive --older-than=30` archives everything older than N days.
- `pnpm action export-emails --view=inbox --output=file.json` dumps a view to JSON.
- Archive, trash, mark-read, and star all accept comma-separated IDs (`--id=id1,id2,id3`) for bulk changes.

**Inline thread previews in agent chat.** When the agent answers a question about a specific thread, it can embed a live preview of the thread directly in the chat message via an `embed` code fence. The preview is a sandboxed iframe that shows the full conversation without leaving the chat, with an "Open in app" button that navigates the main window to that thread.

### How the agent sees your context

- **Current view and thread** — the UI writes `navigation` (view, threadId, focusedEmailId, search, label) whenever you navigate. The agent reads it via `readAppState("navigation")` or `pnpm action view-screen`.
- **Open draft** — if you're composing a reply and ask "help me word this", the agent reads the matching `compose-{id}` entry to see your current subject and body, then writes an updated draft back. The UI picks up the edit live.
- **Thread history** — for context mid-reply, the agent fetches the full thread with `pnpm action get-thread --id=<threadId>`.

### How the agent takes action

- **Mail operations** — archive, trash, star, mark read, send, draft — all run as `pnpm action <name>` scripts under `templates/mail/actions/`.
- **Navigation** — to open a thread or switch views for you, the agent writes `application_state.navigate`, which the UI consumes and deletes. The `pnpm action navigate` script wraps this.
- **Refresh** — after any change, the agent runs `pnpm action refresh-list` so the UI refetches.

### Data model

When a Google account is connected, email lives in Gmail — the app is a view on top. When no account is connected, emails live in the SQL settings store under `getSetting("local-emails")` (empty by default).

| Store / Table                 | What it holds                                                  |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `getSetting("local-emails")`  | Local email fallback when no Google account is connected       |
| `getSetting("labels")`        | System and user labels, with unread counts                     |
| `getSetting("mail-settings")` | User profile, tracking preferences, signature, aliases         |
| `getSetting("aliases")`       | Email aliases                                                  |
| `queued_email_drafts` table   | Teammate-requested drafts awaiting owner review/send           |
| `email_tracking` table        | Open-pixel events for sent messages                            |
| `email_link_tracking` table   | Link-click events for sent messages                            |
| `application_state` table     | `navigation`, `navigate`, `compose-{id}` entries (ephemeral)   |
| `oauth_tokens` table          | Google OAuth tokens (provider `"google"`, one row per account) |

Emails flowing through the API have the shape `{ id, threadId, from, to, cc, subject, snippet, body, date, isRead, isStarred, isArchived, isTrashed, labelIds, accountEmail, attachments }`.

Routes in the UI:

- `/_index.tsx` — redirects to the default inbox view.
- `/$view.tsx` — a list view (`inbox`, `starred`, `sent`, `drafts`, `archive`, `trash`, etc.).
- `/$view.$threadId.tsx` — a list view with a specific thread open.
- `/email` — the embedded thread preview used in agent chat.
- `/settings` — account connections, tracking, automations.
- `/team` — team members and shared resources.

### Customizing it

Mail is yours to change. Everything important lives in a handful of places — start there.

**Adding an agent capability.** Add a new file under `templates/mail/actions/` using `defineAction`. Your action becomes an agent tool, a CLI command (`pnpm action <name>`), and a typed frontend hook surface through `useActionQuery` / `useActionMutation`. Look at `templates/mail/actions/star-email.ts` for a short example or `templates/mail/actions/manage-automations.ts` for one with multiple sub-actions. See the [actions](/docs/actions) docs for the full pattern.

**Changing the UI.** Routes are in `templates/mail/app/routes/` and components in `templates/mail/app/components/email/` and `templates/mail/app/components/layout/`. The app uses shadcn/ui primitives from `app/components/ui/` and Tabler Icons — stick to those.

**Changing how the agent behaves.** Agent guidance lives in `templates/mail/AGENTS.md` and the skills in `templates/mail/.agents/skills/` (`email-drafts`, `real-time-sync`, `security`, `self-modifying-code`, and others). Agent behavior is changed by editing markdown — not code.

**Changing data or settings.** Schemas for the tracking tables and related structures are in `templates/mail/server/db/`. Settings reads and writes go through `readSetting` / `writeSetting` from `@agent-native/core/settings`. Application state (navigation, drafts, one-shot commands) uses `readAppState` / `writeAppState` from `@agent-native/core/application-state`.

**Adding a new automation action type.** Extend the action schema in `templates/mail/actions/manage-automations.ts` and the executor in `templates/mail/actions/trigger-automations.ts`.

**Changing keyboard shortcuts.** Keybind handlers live in `templates/mail/app/components/email/` — search for `useHotkeys` or `addEventListener("keydown"` to find where each key is wired.

Ask the agent to make any of these changes for you. The agent can edit its own source — see [Self-Modifying Code](/docs/key-concepts#agent-modifies-code).
