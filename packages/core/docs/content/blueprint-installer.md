# Blueprint Installer

`agent-native add` is **not** a dumb scaffolder that writes files for you. It emits a curated Markdown _integration blueprint_ to stdout. You pipe that blueprint into your own coding agent (Claude Code, Codex, …), which applies the changes against the live repo with full context.

This fits the agent-applies-changes, filesystem-first house style: the framework supplies the recipe (the canonical files to touch, the rules to honor, the verification step), and the coding agent does the editing.

```bash
agent-native add provider stripe | claude
agent-native add channel discord  | codex
```

## Usage {#usage}

```bash
agent-native add <kind> <name>            # print a curated blueprint
agent-native add <kind> <https://docs…>   # research-and-integrate from a URL
agent-native add --list                   # list available kinds and blueprints
```

- A bare **name** resolves a curated blueprint from `blueprints/<kind>/<name>.md`.
- A **URL** instead of a name emits a generic _research-and-integrate_ blueprint for that kind, with the URL embedded as the research starting point (a URL is a research seed, not a known recipe).
- The blueprint goes to **stdout**; diagnostics go to stderr, so `… | claude` only ever receives the blueprint.

## Seeded blueprints {#seeded}

`agent-native add --list` shows what ships in the box:

| Kind       | Name      | What it sets up                                                                    |
| ---------- | --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `provider` | `stripe`  | Wire a provider into the `provider-api` substrate (catalog / docs / request trio). |
| `channel`  | `discord` | Implement a `PlatformAdapter` inbound webhook channel and register it.             |
| `sandbox`  | `docker`  | Implement the `SandboxAdapter` seam to run `run-code` in a Docker container.       |
| `action`   | `crud`    | Add a single multi-surface `defineAction` with a Zod schema (one `update` over N). |

Each blueprint is self-contained: the coding agent reading it gets the files to touch, the framework rules to honor (actions are the single source of truth, never hardcode secrets, scope ownable data, add a changeset for `packages/*` source), and a concrete **Verify** section.

## URL → research blueprint {#url}

When you pass a URL the kind doesn't have a curated recipe for (or want a fresh integration), `add` emits a generic "research-and-integrate" blueprint with the URL as the seed:

```bash
agent-native add provider https://docs.example.com/api | claude
```

The generated blueprint tells the coding agent to fetch the URL (and the pages it links to) for the real endpoints, auth model, payload shapes, and signature/verification requirements — _not_ to guess from training data — then implement and verify. It also carries kind-specific guidance (e.g. a `provider` URL is steered toward the `provider-api` substrate; a `channel` URL toward a `PlatformAdapter`).

## Adding your own blueprint {#authoring}

Drop a Markdown file into `packages/core/blueprints/<kind>/<name>.md`. The kind is the subdirectory; the name is the filename without `.md`. It is picked up automatically — `--list`, name resolution, and the catalog all read the directory at runtime. No code change is needed to register it.

Blueprint `.md` files ship in the published package via the `blueprints` entry in `package.json` `files`, so they resolve at `node_modules/@agent-native/core/blueprints/**` for end users.

Write each blueprint as an instruction set for a coding agent with no other context. A good blueprint has:

1. **A one-line goal** and a "you are a coding agent in an agent-native app, apply these as real source changes" framing.
2. **Read first** — the exact files that _are_ the contract.
3. **Files to touch** — concrete paths and what each change does.
4. **Framework rules to honor** — actions-first, no hardcoded secrets, scope ownable data, add a changeset for publishable-package source.
5. **Verify** — typecheck, a focused `*.spec.ts`, and an end-to-end check.

> [!TIP]
> A new curated blueprint under an existing kind needs no code — but if you create a brand-new kind directory, that kind shows up in `--list` automatically too.
