# Actions

Actions are the single source of truth for anything your app does. Define an action once with `defineAction()`, drop it in `actions/`, and it's immediately available as:

- **An agent tool** — the agent sees it with a zod-derived JSON Schema and can call it in chat.
- **A typesafe React mutation** — `useActionMutation("name")` on the frontend, types inferred from the schema.
- **An HTTP endpoint** — `POST /_agent-native/actions/<name>` (auto-mounted by the framework).
- **An MCP tool** — exposed to Claude, ChatGPT custom MCP apps, Claude Desktop/Code, Cursor, Codex, and any other MCP client.
- **An A2A tool** — called by other agent-native apps over A2A.
- **A CLI command** — `pnpm action <name>` for scripting and dev loops.

One definition, six consumers. This is rung 3 of the [ladder](/docs/what-is-agent-native#the-ladder).

## Defining an action {#defining}

```ts
// actions/reply-to-email.ts
import { defineAction } from "@agent-native/core";
import { z } from "zod";

export default defineAction({
  description: "Reply to an email thread in the user's voice.",
  schema: z.object({
    emailId: z.string().describe("The id of the email to reply to."),
    body: z.string().describe("The reply body, in markdown."),
  }),
  run: async ({ emailId, body }) => {
    await db.insert(replies).values({ emailId, body });
    return { ok: true, emailId };
  },
});
```

That's it. The framework auto-discovers every file in `actions/` and mounts them on startup.

### Schema options {#schemas}

`schema` accepts any [Standard Schema](https://standardschema.dev)-compatible library:

- **Zod** (v4) — most common, best type inference, auto-converts to JSON Schema.
- **Valibot** — minimal bundle size if that matters.
- **ArkType** — if you like the syntax.

The schema is converted to JSON Schema for the Claude API tool definition, _and_ used at runtime to validate inputs before `run()` fires. Invalid inputs never reach your handler.

### HTTP config {#http}

By default every action is exposed as `POST /_agent-native/actions/<name>`. Override with the `http` option:

```ts
export default defineAction({
  description: "Get details for a lead.",
  schema: z.object({ leadId: z.string() }),
  http: { method: "GET", path: "leads/:leadId" }, // optional override
  run: async ({ leadId }) => {
    return await db.select().from(leads).where(eq(leads.id, leadId));
  },
});
```

- **`http: { method: "GET" | "POST" | "PUT" | "DELETE" }`** — default `POST`. `GET` actions are auto-marked `readOnly` so successful calls don't trigger a UI poll-refresh.
- **`http: { path: "..." }`** — override the route path under `/_agent-native/actions/`. Defaults to the filename.
- **`http: false`** — disable the HTTP endpoint entirely. Agent + CLI only.
- **`readOnly: true`** — explicitly skip the poll-refresh even for POST actions that don't mutate.
- **`parallelSafe: true`** — allow a mutating action to run concurrently with other same-turn tool calls. Only set this when the action is internally concurrency-safe and order-independent; mutating actions serialize by default.

### Extension callability {#tool-callable}

Extensions (Alpine.js mini-apps that run inside sandboxed iframes — see [Extensions](/docs/extensions)) call actions via `appAction(name, params)`. Because a shared extension's HTML/JS executes inside the _viewer's_ session, an action invoked from an extension runs with the viewer's permissions, secrets, and SQL scope. For high-blast-radius operations, that is too much trust to grant by default.

Use the `toolCallable` flag to control this (the flag name is kept for backward compatibility — it gates extension iframe callability):

```ts
export default defineAction({
  description: "Delete the current user's account.",
  toolCallable: false, // never callable from an extension iframe
  schema: z.object({ confirm: z.literal("yes") }),
  run: async () => {
    /* ... */
  },
});
```

| Value       | Behavior                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `true`      | Allow (same as undefined). Useful for documentation of intent.                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `false`     | Explicit deny. The extension bridge returns 403; the action is still callable normally from the UI, agent, CLI, MCP, and A2A.                                                                                                                     |
| `undefined` | **Default-allow.** Extensions are intra-org and typically authored by trusted teammates, so the default trusts the org-level access controls. Set `false` only for genuinely auth-adjacent operations (account deletion, org membership changes). |

Enforcement: the parent host (`ToolViewer.tsx` / `EmbeddedTool.tsx` — physical class names retained) tags every outbound action call from an extension iframe with the header `X-Agent-Native-Tool-Bridge: 1`. The action route layer reads this header and applies the rule above. Regular UI/agent/CLI/A2A calls do not carry the header and are unaffected. The header is set by the React host; the iframe's user-authored content cannot spoof it because the bridge sanitizes iframe-supplied headers.

Set `toolCallable: false` for actions that:

- delete or transfer ownership of any account/org,
- change auth state (sign-out-all sessions, rotate tokens),
- modify org membership (invite/remove members, change roles),
- change resource visibility or grant share access (the framework's built-in `share-resource`, `unshare-resource`, and `set-resource-visibility` are already opted out).

## Calling it from the UI {#ui}

Two hooks, both in `@agent-native/core/client`. Types are inferred from your `defineAction` schemas — no manual type declarations.

### `useActionMutation` {#use-action-mutation}

For actions that change state:

```tsx
import { useActionMutation } from "@agent-native/core/client";

const { mutate, isPending } = useActionMutation("reply-to-email");

<Button
  disabled={isPending}
  onClick={() => mutate({ emailId, body: "Thanks!" })}
>
  Send Reply
</Button>;
```

On success, the framework emits a change event with `source: "action"` so `useActionQuery` consumers and active query observers refetch automatically. See [Live Sync](/docs/key-concepts#polling-sync).

### `useActionQuery` {#use-action-query}

For read-only GET actions:

```ts
import { useActionQuery } from "@agent-native/core/client";

const { data, isLoading } = useActionQuery("get-lead", { leadId });
```

The query is cached under `["action", "get-lead", { leadId }]` and auto-invalidated on any mutating action that completes.

## Calling it from the CLI {#cli}

Every action is runnable via `pnpm action`:

```bash
pnpm action reply-to-email --emailId thread-123 --body "Thanks!"
```

Flags are parsed into the shape your schema expects. Useful for agent-dev loops, scripts, and cron.

## Calling it from another agent (A2A) {#a2a}

If your app is an [A2A](/docs/a2a-protocol) peer, other agent-native apps discover your actions automatically and can call them by name. Same-origin deploys skip JWT signing; cross-origin uses a shared `A2A_SECRET`.

## Exposing it over MCP {#mcp}

With MCP enabled, your actions show up in the framework's MCP server at `/_agent-native/mcp`. Stdio/static-token developer clients see the full connected action surface. OAuth app hosts that request `mcp:apps` get a compact catalog containing app-facing builtins and actions with `mcpApp`; `publicAgent.expose` is still the opt-in for safe read/ingest tools outside that compact app catalog. See [MCP Protocol](/docs/mcp-protocol).

For UI-capable MCP hosts, actions can also attach an optional MCP Apps resource.
Use the shared full-app embed helper when the action needs an inline experience.
MCP Apps should embed the real React route; do not hand-write a separate plain
HTML product UI.

The pattern is the same focused link we already return for external agents:
the action exposes the operation, `link` points at the route with the right URL
or deep-link params, and `embedApp()` uses that same target as the inline app.
This works for draft emails, filtered inboxes, calendar event drafts, full
dashboards, saved analyses, extension routes, decks, design editors, and any
other state the app can load from a route.

Keep MCP Apps URL-first. Prefer a durable app route such as
`/dashboards/:id`, `/compose?draft=...`, or `/chart?payload=...` over passing
large opaque state through the bridge. When an action's `link` and `mcpApp`
should point at the same route, use `embedRoute()` to create both from one pure
path builder. The host bridge is for host-owned capabilities: model context
updates, host-mediated links, host context, and display-mode requests.

When a whole app surface is too much, embed a narrow route that renders a real
shared React component instead. For example, Analytics can render `/chart` with
a compact `SqlPanel` URL payload so the MCP host shows one live chart while the
implementation still reuses the dashboard chart component.

```ts
import { embedRoute } from "@agent-native/core";

export default defineAction({
  description: "Create an email draft for review.",
  schema: z.object({ body: z.string() }),
  run: async ({ body }) => ({ body }),
  ...embedRoute({
    title: "Review draft",
    openLabel: "Open in Mail",
    path: ({ result }) => ({
      label: "Open draft in Mail",
      url: "/_agent-native/open?app=mail&view=inbox",
    }),
  }),
});
```

This advertises the MCP Apps extension (`io.modelcontextprotocol/ui`), exposes the HTML via MCP resources/templates, and includes standard MCP Apps plus ChatGPT Apps SDK widget metadata for compatible hosts. Keep `link` as the fallback for CLI and non-UI MCP clients; see [External Agents](/docs/external-agents#mcp-apps).

The helper launches the action's `link` target through `/_agent-native/embed/start` with a short-lived browser session, so routes such as full dashboards, filtered inboxes, drafts, and extension pages can reuse the app's React components directly.
Same-app `open_app({ embed: true })` mints that embed-start ticket during the
original tool call, and custom actions can return `embedStartUrl` for the same
fast path; otherwise the resource falls back to the app-only
`create_embed_session` helper.
Standard hosts navigate the MCP App frame directly to that signed route.
Claude web uses a single-frame transplant path that hydrates the signed app
HTML inside Claude's MCP App iframe because Claude does not reliably allow
app-owned child iframes or external frame navigation. ChatGPT web uses a
controlled route iframe for stable `window.openai` host APIs and bounded height
control.

Embedded routes can use the exported client helpers for the MCP App host
bridge. Direct route embeds and Claude's transplanted route post standard
`ui/*` JSON-RPC messages to the host, while the ChatGPT controlled-frame path
and explicit diagnostic iframe path proxy `agentNative.mcpHost.*` messages
through the launch wrapper.
When a submitted app prompt should continue the host chat, call
`sendToAgentChat()` from the embedded route; it sends hidden model context and
then posts a visible user message through the host bridge where supported.
Design those routes with their own scrolling, because the MCP resource reports
a bounded inline height rather than asking the host to size itself to the full
app document. `embedApp({ height })` defaults to a `560px` shell, clamps to
`320-900px`, and subtracts `44px` for wrapper chrome before sizing the embedded
route viewport.

## Standard actions {#standard-actions}

Every template should include these two for [context awareness](/docs/context-awareness):

### view-screen {#view-screen}

Reads the current navigation state, fetches contextual data, and returns a snapshot of what the user sees. The agent calls this when it needs a fresh look at the screen.

```ts
// actions/view-screen.ts
import { defineAction } from "@agent-native/core";
import { readAppState } from "@agent-native/core/application-state";
import { z } from "zod";

export default defineAction({
  description: "Read the current screen state for context.",
  schema: z.object({}),
  http: { method: "GET" },
  run: async () => {
    const navigation = await readAppState("navigation");
    const screen: Record<string, unknown> = { navigation };

    if (navigation?.view === "inbox") {
      const res = await fetch(
        `${process.env.APP_URL}/api/emails?label=${navigation.label}`,
      );
      screen.emailList = await res.json();
    }

    return screen;
  },
});
```

### navigate {#navigate}

Writes a one-shot navigation command to application state. The UI reads it, navigates, and deletes the entry.

```ts
// actions/navigate.ts
import { defineAction } from "@agent-native/core";
import { writeAppState } from "@agent-native/core/application-state";
import { z } from "zod";

export default defineAction({
  description: "Navigate the user to a view.",
  schema: z.object({
    view: z.string(),
    threadId: z.string().optional(),
  }),
  run: async (args) => {
    await writeAppState("navigate", args);
    return { ok: true };
  },
});
```

## Legacy CLI-style actions {#legacy-cli-actions}

The framework still supports older `export default async function(args)` actions that aren't wrapped in `defineAction` — useful for one-off dev scripts that don't need agent/HTTP exposure. These are CLI-only; they don't appear as agent tools, don't mount HTTP endpoints, and don't get typesafe frontend hooks.

```ts
// actions/debug-dump.ts — CLI-only
import { parseArgs } from "@agent-native/core";

export default async function main(args: string[]) {
  const { table } = parseArgs(args);
  // one-off script you wouldn't want the agent to call
}
```

New code should prefer `defineAction()`. Reach for this pattern only when you deliberately don't want the action exposed to agents or the UI.

### `parseArgs(args)` {#parseargs}

Helper for legacy-style actions. Parses CLI arguments in `--key value` or `--key=value` format:

```ts
import { parseArgs } from "@agent-native/core";

const args = parseArgs(["--name", "Steve", "--verbose", "--count=3"]);
// { name: "Steve", verbose: "true", count: "3" }
```

## Utility functions {#utility-functions}

| Function                | Returns   | Description                                           |
| ----------------------- | --------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `loadEnv(path?)`        | `void`    | Load `.env` from project root (or custom path).       |
| `camelCaseArgs(args)`   | `Record`  | Convert kebab-case keys to camelCase.                 |
| `isValidPath(p)`        | `boolean` | Validate a relative path (no traversal, no absolute). |
| `isValidProjectPath(p)` | `boolean` | Validate a project slug (e.g. `my-project`).          |
| `ensureDir(dir)`        | `void`    | `mkdir -p` helper.                                    |
| `fail(message)`         | `never`   | Print to stderr and `exit(1)`.                        |
