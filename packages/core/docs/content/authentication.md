# Authentication

Agent-native apps use [Better Auth](https://better-auth.com) for authentication with an account-first design. Users create an account on first visit and get real identity from day one.

## Overview {#overview}

Auth is configured automatically via `autoMountAuth(app)` in the auth server plugin. The behavior depends on your environment:

- **Default:** Better Auth with email/password + social providers. Onboarding page shown on first visit.
- **Remote MCP OAuth:** Standard OAuth 2.1 for MCP hosts such as Claude Code and ChatGPT connectors.
- **Custom:** Bring your own auth via `getSession` callback.

Local development uses the same Better Auth flow as production — there is no dev auth bypass, and `getSession()` never falls back to a `local@localhost` sentinel. The first time you load a template the framework auto-creates a throwaway dev account and signs you in, so you are not stuck at a login wall (disable with `AGENT_NATIVE_DISABLE_AUTO_DEV_ACCOUNT=1` to use the normal signup page). `AUTH_MODE=local` only affects CLI/agent identity resolution (which signed-in dev user `pnpm action` runs as) — it is not a browser login bypass. Email verification is skipped by default in development (and when no email provider is configured), so signup is just an email + password.

## Better Auth (Default) {#better-auth}

By default, Better Auth powers authentication. It provides:

- Email/password registration and login
- Social providers (Google, GitHub, and 35+ others)
- Organizations with roles and invitations
- JWT tokens for API and A2A access
- Bearer token support for programmatic clients

Better Auth routes are mounted at `/_agent-native/auth/ba/*`. The framework also provides backward-compatible endpoints:

- `GET /_agent-native/auth/session` — get current session
- `POST /_agent-native/auth/login` — email/password login
- `POST /_agent-native/auth/register` — create account
- `POST /_agent-native/auth/logout` — sign out

## Cookie Realms {#cookie-realms}

Standalone apps keep their framework session cookie isolated by app when an
app slug is available (`APP_NAME`, or the package name in local dev). Better
Auth keeps its production standalone cookie prefix stable as `an` so existing
sessions are not renamed casually.

Workspace mode (`AGENT_NATIVE_WORKSPACE=1`) uses one shared session realm
because workspace apps share an origin and database. Custom same-database
subdomain deployments can opt into shared cookies with `COOKIE_DOMAIN`.

First-party hosted apps at `*.agent-native.com` are different: each app has its
own auth database, so `COOKIE_DOMAIN=.agent-native.com` is ignored by default
and the app uses an isolated cookie namespace instead. Cross-app sign-in for
those apps should go through [Cross-App SSO](/docs/cross-app-sso). First-party
deploys must provide `APP_NAME` or a derivable app URL (`APP_URL`, `URL`,
`DEPLOY_PRIME_URL`, or `DEPLOY_URL`); otherwise startup fails instead of
falling back to the shared `an_session` name. If a first-party deployment
intentionally shares one auth database across subdomains, set
`AGENT_NATIVE_SHARE_COOKIE_DOMAIN=1` alongside `COOKIE_DOMAIN`.

## QA Accounts {#qa-accounts}

Local development and tests skip signup email verification by default, so you
can create real email/password accounts without waiting on an inbox. To force
verification locally while testing that flow, set `AUTH_SKIP_EMAIL_VERIFICATION=0`.

For hosted QA environments where testers need real accounts but should not wait
on email delivery, set:

```bash
AUTH_SKIP_EMAIL_VERIFICATION=1
```

When this flag is set, email/password signup does not require email
verification and the signup verification email is not sent. Use it only for QA
or preview environments, and name test accounts with a `+qa` address
(`name+qa@example.com`) so they are easy to identify.

## Social Providers {#social-providers}

Set environment variables to enable social login. Better Auth auto-detects them:

```bash
# Google OAuth
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret

# GitHub OAuth
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
```

Templates that use `createGoogleAuthPlugin()` show a "Sign in with Google" page. The Google OAuth callback handles mobile deep linking for native apps automatically.

### OAuth State Signing {#oauth-state-secret}

Set `OAUTH_STATE_SECRET` to a random 32+ char value in production so OAuth state envelopes (Google, Atlassian, Zoom) are HMAC-signed with a dedicated key independent of any third-party secret. See [Security — OAuth State Signing](/docs/security#oauth-state) for the full requirements and threat model.

## Organizations {#organizations}

The framework provides a built-in organization system. This is the framework's own `org/` module — backed by the `organizations` and `org_members` tables — not Better Auth's organization plugin, which is intentionally not registered. Every app supports:

- Creating organizations
- Inviting members with roles (`owner`, `admin`, `member`)
- Switching active organization
- Per-org data scoping via `org_id` columns

The active org is tracked on the session as `session.orgId`, and switching orgs changes the data the user and agent see. Data scoping itself happens further down the stack — see [Security & Data Scoping](/docs/security#data-scoping) for the full `session.orgId → AGENT_ORG_ID → SQL` pipeline and the access guards. The [Multi-Tenancy](/docs/multi-tenancy) docs cover the org-management surface.

### Typed orgs and app entitlements are application policy {#typed-orgs}

Domain-specific org types — `practice`, `lab`, `clinic`, `agency` — are **not** a new framework construct, and the org system does not need extending to support them. Model them in app logic on top of the built-in `organizations` and `org_members` tables: store the type as your own app column (e.g. an `org_profiles.kind` row keyed by `org_id`), resolve the active tenant through `session.orgId` as usual, and keep every read/write inside the existing `org_id` SQL scoping model. Branch on the looked-up type in actions and UI to gate which apps and features that org may use.

Likewise, _which_ org (or org type) is entitled to _which_ app is application policy, not an auth-layer feature. Enforce it in your `authPlugin` / route guards plus a workspace entitlement table; the framework gives you the org identity and scoping, you define the entitlement matrix. For the deployment-vs-policy split — shared apps, tenant-specific apps, and the entitlement matrix in one workspace — see [Multi-App Workspaces — Shared apps, tenant-specific apps, and entitlements](/docs/multi-app-workspace#tenant-app-policy).

## Static MCP Bearer Tokens {#access-tokens}

`ACCESS_TOKEN` and `ACCESS_TOKENS` are not browser auth and do not make an app private. They remain only as static bearer credentials for MCP/connect clients that cannot use the OAuth flow.

```bash
# Single token
ACCESS_TOKEN=my-secret-token

# Multiple tokens
ACCESS_TOKENS=token1,token2,token3
```

Configuring these variables never renders a token login page for visitors. Web sign-in stays on Better Auth or your custom `getSession` provider.

## Remote MCP OAuth {#remote-mcp-oauth}

Every app's MCP endpoint can act as a standard protected MCP resource. OAuth-capable clients can be configured with only the remote MCP URL:

```text
https://mail.agent-native.com/_agent-native/mcp
```

Unauthenticated MCP requests return a `WWW-Authenticate` challenge pointing at `/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource`. The client then discovers the app's OAuth metadata, dynamically registers a public client, opens the app's authorization page, and exchanges an authorization code with PKCE for access and refresh tokens.

Access tokens are signed with `A2A_SECRET` when set, otherwise `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`. They carry the signed user/org identity and the `mcp:read`, `mcp:write`, and/or `mcp:apps` scopes, and are audience-bound to the exact MCP resource URL. Refresh tokens are stored only as hashes and rotate on every refresh. Tool calls and MCP Apps resource reads run inside the same request context as the signed-in user; the embedded MCP App iframe never receives raw OAuth tokens.

`npx @agent-native/core@latest connect <url> --client claude-code` writes the URL-only MCP entry for this standard flow. For clients that cannot perform remote MCP OAuth, use the Connect page or `npx @agent-native/core@latest connect --token <token>` fallback to write an explicit bearer-token entry.

## Bring Your Own Auth {#byoa}

Pass a custom `getSession` callback to use any auth provider (Clerk, Auth0, Firebase, etc.):

```typescript
// server/plugins/auth.ts
import { createAuthPlugin } from "@agent-native/core/server";

export default createAuthPlugin({
  getSession: async (event) => {
    // Your custom auth logic here
    const session = await myAuthProvider.verify(event);
    if (!session) return null;
    return { email: session.email };
  },
  publicPaths: ["/api/webhooks"],
});
```

## Public Workspace Apps {#public-workspace-apps}

Workspace apps are internal by default. To let anonymous visitors load a public
site while keeping management pages behind auth, declare route access in
`apps/<id>/package.json`:

```json
{
  "agent-native": {
    "workspaceApp": {
      "audience": "public",
      "protectedPaths": ["/admin"]
    }
  }
}
```

For the inverse shape, keep the default internal audience and expose only
specific public pages:

```json
{
  "agent-native": {
    "workspaceApp": {
      "publicPaths": ["/", "/share"]
    }
  }
}
```

`publicPaths` and `protectedPaths` use prefix matching, so `"/admin"` also
covers `"/admin/users"`. These settings open page navigation only. Framework
routes (`/_agent-native/*`) and custom API routes (`/api/*`) still require auth
unless the app explicitly adds those prefixes to
`createAuthPlugin({ publicPaths: [...] })`.

## Session API {#session-api}

The session object returned by `getSession(event)` has this shape:

```typescript
interface AuthSession {
  email: string; // User's email (primary identifier)
  userId?: string; // Better Auth user ID
  token?: string; // Session token
  name?: string; // Display name from the auth provider, when available
  image?: string; // Profile image from the auth provider, when available
  orgId?: string; // Active organization ID
  orgRole?: string; // Role in active org (owner/admin/member)
}
```

On the client, use the `useSession()` hook:

```typescript
import { useSession } from "@agent-native/core/client";

function MyComponent() {
  const { session, isLoading } = useSession();
  if (isLoading) return <p>Loading...</p>;
  if (!session) return <p>Not signed in</p>;
  return <p>Hello, {session.email}</p>;
}
```

## Sign-In with Return URL {#sign-in-return-url}

Templates with **public pages** (share links, embeds, marketing pages) often need an in-page CTA that asks anonymous viewers to sign in and brings them back to the page they were on. The framework provides a single entry point for this:

```
/_agent-native/sign-in?return=<same-origin-path>
```

When an anonymous viewer hits this URL, the framework's login page is served. After a successful sign-in (any flow — token, email/password, or Google OAuth), the viewer is 302'd to `return`.

The `return` parameter is validated as a **same-origin path**. Network-path references (`//evil.com/...`), absolute URLs, `data:` / `javascript:` schemes, and embedded control characters all fall back to `/`. The validated path is reconstructed from the URL parser, not echoed back from the input.

**From a React component:**

```tsx
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";

function SignInCta() {
  const onClick = () => {
    const ret = window.location.pathname + window.location.search;
    window.location.href =
      "/_agent-native/sign-in?return=" + encodeURIComponent(ret);
  };
  return <Button onClick={onClick}>Sign in</Button>;
}
```

### Bookmarked private paths

When an anonymous user navigates directly to a private path like `/dashboard`, the framework already serves the login page at that URL — after successful sign-in, the page reloads and the user lands on `/dashboard`. No special handling needed; this works for token, email/password, **and** Google OAuth.

### Behind the scenes: Google OAuth

Both flows (the explicit `/_agent-native/sign-in` entrypoint and the bookmarked-path case) thread the return URL through the OAuth state. The state is HMAC-signed, so it can't be forged in transit. On the callback, the return URL is re-validated as same-origin before the redirect — so a leaked signing key still can't be turned into an open-redirect oracle.

If your template wraps `/_agent-native/google/auth-url` directly (e.g. mail and calendar templates do, to widen scopes), accept a `?return=<path>` query and forward it via the options-object form of `encodeOAuthState`:

```typescript
const returnUrl = getQuery(event).return;
const state = encodeOAuthState({
  redirectUri,
  desktop,
  returnUrl: typeof returnUrl === "string" ? returnUrl : undefined,
});
```

The default `/_agent-native/google/auth-url` route does this automatically — only override if your template needs custom OAuth handling.
