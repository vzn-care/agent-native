# Visual Plans

Agent-Native Plans is visual plan mode for coding agents. It turns an ordinary
Codex, Claude Code, Markdown, or pasted implementation plan into a structured
review surface with rich text, diagrams, wireframes, annotated code walkthroughs
and file trees, annotations, comments, and shareable links.

It comes down to two commands. `/visual-plan` builds a plan **before** the agent
writes code. `/visual-recap` turns a change that **already** happened — a PR,
commit, branch, or git diff — into a high-altitude visual code review. Both open
the same review surface, so you annotate, comment, and hand feedback back to the
agent the same way.

![Agent-Native Plans review surface](https://cdn.builder.io/api/v1/image/assets%2FYJIGb4i01jvw0SRdL5Bt%2Fdd73f749f8c54dbcb577420ab1a18788)

There are two ways into Plans:

- **From your coding agent (CLI)** — one command installs the skill, registers
  the hosted Plans connector, and authenticates it.
- **In the browser** — anyone you share with can open the editor and create or
  edit as a **guest, with no sign-up**. They sign in only when they want to save
  or share.

## Install the skill {#install}

Use the Agent-Native CLI. This is the recommended setup because it installs the
Plans skill instructions, registers the hosted Plans MCP connector, **and** runs
the client-specific auth/setup flow in one step, so your first tool call does not
hit an OAuth wall:

```bash
npx @agent-native/core@latest skills add visual-plan
```

The command installs both commands: `/visual-plan` and `/visual-recap`.

If you are using a chat-based host that accepts MCP connector URLs directly
(rather than a CLI-configured client), connect the hosted Plans connector at
`https://plan.agent-native.com/_agent-native/mcp` — see [MCP Clients](/docs/mcp-clients) for client-specific setup.

Authentication is a one-time browser sign-in at setup — this is intended, and it
is what lets the agent persist and share the plans it generates. What the auth
step does depends on your client:

- **OAuth-capable hosts** (Claude Code) get a URL-only MCP entry plus a prompt to
  run `/mcp` and choose **Authenticate**.
- **Codex / Cowork** run a short browser device-code flow: the CLI prints a code,
  opens the verification page, and writes the connector once you approve.
- In a **non-interactive shell or CI**, the auth step is skipped and the exact
  command to run later is printed for you.

By default the CLI targets every supported local client it can configure. Pass
`--client codex`, `--client claude-code`, or another specific client when you
want to narrow setup to one host:

```bash
npx @agent-native/core@latest skills add visual-plan
```

Pass `--no-connect` to register the connector without authenticating, then run
`npx @agent-native/core@latest connect https://plan.agent-native.com --client all`
whenever you are ready, or choose a narrower `--client`:

```bash
npx @agent-native/core@latest skills add visual-plan --no-connect
```

To auto-generate a recap on **every pull request**, pass `--with-github-action`.
This writes a GitHub Action that runs the `visual-recap` skill on each PR and
posts an interactive recap plan with an inline screenshot as a sticky comment —
see [PR Visual Recap](/docs/pr-visual-recap).

```bash
npx @agent-native/core@latest skills add visual-plan --with-github-action
```

After the workflow is written, run `npx @agent-native/core@latest recap setup` to configure
GitHub Actions secrets/variables where possible and `npx @agent-native/core@latest recap doctor`
to verify the repo is ready.

If you only want the portable instruction file through the open Skills CLI, use:

```bash
npx skills@latest add BuilderIO/agent-native --skill visual-plan
```

That installs the skill instructions only. It does not register the hosted MCP
connector, so use the Agent-Native CLI path when you want the one-command setup.

> **Prefer a one-install plugin?** Claude Code and Codex can add
> `BuilderIO/agent-native` directly as a plugin marketplace, which bundles the
> Plan skills _and_ the connector in one install and auto-updates as the skills
> improve — see [Plan plugin & marketplace](/docs/plan-plugin).

### Open Plans inside VS Code {#vscode-extension}

If you live in VS Code, the Agent Native VS Code extension can open the same
Plan review surface in a side panel instead of sending you to a separate browser
tab. Plans tools still return the normal web link, and the MCP metadata also
includes a VS Code handoff URL:

```text
vscode://builderio.agent-native/open?url=<encoded-plan-url>
```

The extension handles that URI, opens the decoded Plan URL in a VS Code webview,
and includes a command to run the existing Agent Native MCP connect flow for VS
Code / GitHub Copilot. This is especially useful from Claude Code or another
coding-agent workflow where the plan should stay next to the files being edited.

## Use it from your coding agent

After installation, ask your agent for the command that fits the work:

- `/visual-plan` creates a structured plan **before** implementation — for
  architecture, backend, refactor, UI, or mixed product work — pulling in
  diagrams, wireframes, mockups, clickable prototypes, and annotated code
  walkthroughs and file trees as the work calls for them.
- `/visual-recap` creates a high-altitude **review** of a change that already
  happened — a PR, commit, branch, or git diff — as schema, API, file, and
  before/after blocks instead of a wall of raw diff.

The agent should inspect the codebase first, then create the visual plan when a
wrong direction would be costly. The returned Plans link opens the review UI in
the browser or VS Code, so you can annotate, correct, choose options, and ask for
updates before code changes begin.

When a Codex, Claude Code, Markdown, or pasted plan already exists, use
`/visual-plan`; the agent preserves that source plan and builds the richer review
surface from it instead of starting over.

If the first pass still has answerable decisions, the agent can place an
**Open Questions** form at the bottom of the same plan. Answering it and sending
it to the agent starts a revision turn against the existing plan.

## What you can do with it

- **Review before implementation.** React to diagrams, wireframes, option tabs,
  Open Questions forms, risk notes, annotated code walkthroughs, and code
  previews before the agent edits files.
- **Comment directly on the plan.** Pin feedback to text, images, wireframes, or
  canvas locations; choose whether the comment is for the agent or a human
  reviewer; @mention teammates with inline chips; and resolve comments as the
  plan evolves.
- **Hand feedback to the agent clearly.** Text comments attach to the nearest
  prose block, visual comments include exact target metadata, and browser
  handoff includes focused screenshots for a small set of visual/canvas comment
  locations instead of one hard-to-read giant image.
- **Export the result.** Keep an HTML, Markdown, or JSON receipt of the plan
  when you need a source-control-friendly handoff.

## Editing in the browser as a guest {#guest}

People you share a plan with do not need to install anything. They open the Plans
editor and **create and edit with no sign-up** — they work as a guest. Signing in
is only required when someone wants to **save or share** their own work.

When a guest signs in, the plans they created as a guest are **claimed** into
their account, so nothing they built is lost.

Plan prose edits inline: click into any text section, type, format with the rich
editor toolbar or slash menu, and Plans autosaves the underlying markdown. Review
annotation mode temporarily turns text sections read-only so clicks can pin
feedback; leave review mode to keep editing prose.

## Sharing and commenting {#sharing}

Sharing and commenting are the workflows that need an account:

- **Viewing** a public or shared plan works for anyone with the link — no account
  required.
- **Commenting** on a shared plan requires an agent-native account.
- **Sharing** a plan (publishing it to a link, private sharing, reviewer access,
  cross-device or team review) requires signing in. Google sign-in appears when
  the standard Google OAuth env vars are configured.

The hosted Plans connector lives at `https://plan.agent-native.com/_agent-native/mcp`.
Never put shared secrets in skill files.

## Local-files privacy mode {#local-files}

For privacy-focused work, ask for local-files mode:

```text
Use /visual-plan in local-files mode. Do not write this plan to the Plan DB.
```

or set the convention for your agent environment:

```bash
export AGENT_NATIVE_PLANS_MODE=local-files
```

In this mode the agent writes a local MDX folder and must not call the hosted
Plan MCP tools. Use a repo folder such as `plans/<slug>/` when you want the plan
checked in with the code. Use a temp or ignored folder, such as
`/tmp/agent-native-plans/<slug>/` or `.agent-native/plans/<slug>/`, when the
plan should stay out of git. The folder contains:

- `plan.mdx`
- optional `canvas.mdx`
- optional `prototype.mdx`
- optional `.plan-state.json`

After writing the folder, the agent starts a tiny localhost bridge and opens the
hosted Plan UI against that local-only source:

```bash
npx @agent-native/core@latest plan local check --dir plans/<slug>
npx @agent-native/core@latest plan local serve --dir plans/<slug> --kind plan --open
```

The bridge URL looks like
`https://plan.agent-native.com/local-plans/<slug>?bridge=http://127.0.0.1:...`.
The page is the normal Plan viewer, but the browser fetches `plan.mdx`,
`canvas.mdx`, `prototype.mdx`, `.plan-state.json`, and local image assets from
the localhost bridge. Plan content is not written to the hosted database and is
not sent through hosted Plan actions. Keep the bridge process running while you
review; the URL is local to your machine and is not a shareable team link. The
serve command writes the open URL to `.plan-url` by default so coding agents can
capture it without scraping long-running stdout; treat that file as local-only
because the URL contains the bridge token, and do not commit it.

On macOS, `--open` prefers Chrome/Chromium because Safari can block the hosted
HTTPS Plan page from fetching an HTTP localhost bridge. For headless
troubleshooting, run:

```bash
npx @agent-native/core@latest plan local verify --dir plans/<slug> --kind plan
```

`verify` starts the bridge, checks the private-network preflight and JSON
payload, prints diagnostics, and exits.

If you run the Plan app locally with the same `PLAN_LOCAL_DIR`, you can also
open the editable app route:

```text
http://localhost:<port>/local-plans/<slug>
```

For repo-backed folders, the direct local route can carry the repo-relative
folder path so browser edits keep writing to that folder:

```text
http://localhost:<port>/local-plans/<slug>?path=plans%2F<slug>
```

The Plan app uses `apps.plan.roots[0].path` in `agent-native.json` as the
default repo location for promoted local plans, falling back to `plans/`:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "apps": {
    "plan": {
      "mode": "local-files",
      "roots": [{ "name": "Plans", "path": "plans", "kind": "plans" }]
    }
  }
}
```

Direct local Plan routes include a menu action to save a temporary local folder
into that repo location. After promotion, the page reopens with `?path=...` and
continues autosaving MDX edits to the repo folder.

Local-files mode prevents plan or recap content from going to the Agent-Native
Plan database. It also disables hosted sharing, browser comments, plan history,
and publish/export receipts until you explicitly opt into publishing. To move a
local plan into the hosted database, call `publish-visual-plan` with the local
MDX folder path; this uploads the plan, assigns it a hosted ID, enables sharing
and commenting, and returns the hosted URL. Local-files mode does not
automatically make your coding agent's LLM local; choose a local or approved
model if that privacy boundary matters too.

## Desktop local file sync {#desktop-local-sync}

Agent Native Desktop also gives hosted Plans a native local-folder bridge. This
is different from local-files privacy mode: the hosted Plan database remains the
source of truth for sharing, comments, history, and live review, while Desktop
can mirror the current plan's source files to a folder you choose.

Open a plan in Agent Native Desktop, use the plan menu's **Local files** actions,
then:

- **Link local folder** — choose the folder for that plan's MDX source.
- **Sync to local folder** — write `plan.mdx`, optional `canvas.mdx`,
  optional `prototype.mdx`, optional `.plan-state.json`, and image assets.
- **Import local edits** — read the folder and apply it through
  `import-visual-plan-source` with the plan's current update timestamp.
- **Auto-sync changes** — keep exporting the hosted plan's latest source after
  edits made in the app.

This path does not require cloning the Plan app or running a CLI. It is for
file-first review/editing around a hosted plan, not for keeping plan content out
of the hosted database.

## Deleting hosted plan data {#delete-data}

Signed-in owners can delete their hosted plans and recaps from the Plans list or
the plan action menu.

- **Soft delete** moves the plan to the **Deleted** tab, makes normal plan
  views/direct links stop working, and removes public access by making the row
  private. The SQL rows are retained so the owner can restore the plan later.
- **Restore** is available from the **Deleted** tab for soft-deleted plans.
- **Permanent delete** removes the hosted plan row and plan-scoped comments,
  sections, activity events, version snapshots, share grants, abuse reports, and
  SQL asset records. The UI requires typing `DELETE <plan-id>` before the final
  button enables.

Permanent delete removes the Plan app's database records and SQL-backed asset
bytes/references. If a deployment uses an external upload provider, provider
object retention follows that provider's lifecycle because the shared upload
abstraction does not currently expose object deletion. Local-files privacy mode
keeps the source in your local MDX folder instead; deleting hosted data does not
touch local files.

## Useful prompts

- "Use `/visual-plan` before changing the auth flow."
- "Create a `/visual-plan` for the new onboarding screen with mobile and desktop states."
- "Use `/visual-plan` on the Markdown plan below and make it easier to review."
- "Run `/visual-recap` on this PR so I can review the shape of the change first."
- "Use `/visual-recap` on the diff between `main` and this branch."
- "Use `/visual-recap` in local-files mode so no recap content is written to the Plan DB."

## Recovering from auth errors {#auth-errors}

If a Plans tool ever returns `needs auth`, `Unauthorized`, or `Session
terminated`, do not keep retrying it. Authenticate the connector with
`npx -y @agent-native/core@latest reconnect https://plan.agent-native.com --client codex`
for Codex, or re-run `/mcp` → **Authenticate** in an OAuth-capable host. Start a
new Codex thread or restart/reload the relevant client before expecting the tool
registry to update.

## For developers

The rest of this doc is for anyone forking or self-hosting the Plans template.
Most users should install the skill with the CLI instead of scaffolding the app.

### Quick start

```bash
npx @agent-native/core@latest create my-plans --standalone --template plan
cd my-plans
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

The hosted app-backed skill uses:

- App: `https://plan.agent-native.com`
- MCP: `https://plan.agent-native.com/_agent-native/mcp`

The local template is useful when you are developing Plans itself, testing local persistence, or running a fully self-hosted review surface.

### Data model

Schema lives in `templates/plan/server/db/schema.ts`. Core tables:

| Table              | What it holds                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `plans`            | Each plan or recap — `title`, `brief`, `kind` (plan/recap), `status`, `source`, `html`/`markdown`/`content`, `hosted_plan_id/url`, usage stats, `source_url`, `deleted_at`/`deleted_by` |
| `plan_sections`    | Ordered sections within a plan — `type`, `title`, `body`, `html`, `sort_order`, `created_by`                                                                                            |

| `plan_shares`      | Per-principal share grants (viewer / editor / admin)                                                                                                                                    |
| `plan_guest_mints` | Rate-limit records for guest session issuance                                                                                                                                           |
| `plan_assets`      | Inline image assets stored as base64 (fallback when no upload provider)                                                                                                                 |

- **Context & navigation** — `view-screen`, `navigate`

### Custom MDX blocks {#custom-mdx-blocks}

Plans source files are MDX, but the app does not render arbitrary imported JSX
components. A custom MDX tag must be registered as a Plan block so the server can
parse and serialize it, the browser can render and edit it, and the agent can
see it in the block vocabulary returned by `get-plan-blocks`.

A registered block has three surfaces:

- A React-free schema and MDX config, safe for server and agent code.
- A normalized runtime type/schema entry in `shared/plan-content.ts`.
- A browser block spec with `Read` and optional `Edit` React components.

Keep the block `type` and MDX `tag` stable. The `type` is stored in normalized
plan JSON; the `tag` is the component name in `plan.mdx`. The registry handles
the base MDX attributes `id`, `title`, `summary`, and `editable`, so do not
repeat them in `toAttrs`.

1. Add a shared config for the data shape and MDX round trip.

```ts
// templates/plan/shared/risk-card.config.ts
import { z } from "zod";
import {
  markdown,
  type BlockMdxConfig,
} from "@agent-native/core/blocks/server";

export type RiskCardSeverity = "low" | "medium" | "high";

export interface RiskCardData {
  severity?: RiskCardSeverity;
  body: string;
}

const severities = new Set(["low", "medium", "high"]);

export const riskCardSchema = z.object({
  severity: z.enum(["low", "medium", "high"]).optional(),
  body: markdown(z.string().trim().min(1).max(10_000)),
}) as z.ZodType<RiskCardData>;

export const riskCardMdx: BlockMdxConfig<RiskCardData> = {
  tag: "RiskCard",
  childrenField: "body",
  toAttrs: (data) => ({
    severity: data.severity,
  }),
  fromAttrs: (attrs, children) => {
    const severity = attrs.string("severity");

    return {
      severity: severities.has(severity ?? "")
        ? (severity as RiskCardSeverity)
        : undefined,
      body: children,
    };
  },
};
```

2. Extend the normalized Plan content model in
   `templates/plan/shared/plan-content.ts`.

Add the new `type` to `PlanBlockType`, add a matching block interface to the
`PlanBlock` union, and add the same data shape to `planBlockSchema`. This keeps
database saves, source imports, and `update-block` patches validating the custom
block instead of rejecting it as an unknown type.

3. Register the React-free server spec in
   `templates/plan/shared/plan-block-registry.ts`.

```ts
import {
  BlockRegistry,
  defineBlock,
  registerLibraryBlockConfigs,
  registerBlocks,
} from "@agent-native/core/blocks/server";
import {
  riskCardMdx,
  riskCardSchema,
  type RiskCardData,
} from "./risk-card.config.js";

const ServerReadStub = () => null;

const riskCardServerBlock = defineBlock<RiskCardData>({
  type: "risk-card",
  schema: riskCardSchema,
  mdx: riskCardMdx,
  Read: ServerReadStub,
  placement: ["block"],
  label: "Risk card",
  description: "A markdown risk note with a low, medium, or high severity.",
});

export function registerPlanBlocks(registry: BlockRegistry): void {
  registerLibraryBlockConfigs(registry, {
    overrides: PLAN_SERVER_LIBRARY_OVERRIDES,
  });
  registerBlocks(registry, [riskCardServerBlock]);
}
```

4. Register the browser spec in
   `templates/plan/app/components/plan/planBlocks.tsx`.

```tsx
import {
  defineBlock,
  registerLibraryBlocks,
  registerBlocks,
  type BlockReadProps,
} from "@agent-native/core/blocks";
import {
  riskCardMdx,
  riskCardSchema,
  type RiskCardData,
} from "@shared/risk-card.config";

function RiskCardBlock({ data, blockId, ctx }: BlockReadProps<RiskCardData>) {
  return (
    <section
      className="rounded-md border border-border bg-card p-4"
      data-block-id={blockId}
      data-severity={data.severity}
    >
      <div className="mb-2 text-xs font-semibold uppercase text-muted-foreground">
        {data.severity ?? "risk"}
      </div>
      {ctx.renderMarkdown?.(data.body) ?? (
        <p className="whitespace-pre-wrap text-sm">{data.body}</p>
      )}
    </section>
  );
}

const riskCardBlock = defineBlock<RiskCardData>({
  type: "risk-card",
  schema: riskCardSchema,
  mdx: riskCardMdx,
  Read: RiskCardBlock,
  placement: ["block"],
  editSurface: "panel",
  label: "Risk card",
  description: "A markdown risk note with a low, medium, or high severity.",
  empty: () => ({ severity: "medium", body: "Describe the risk." }),
});

registerLibraryBlocks(planBlockRegistry, {
  overrides: PLAN_LIBRARY_OVERRIDES,
});
registerBlocks(planBlockRegistry, [riskCardBlock]);
```

With that in place, Plan MDX can use:

```mdx
<RiskCard id="risk-auth" severity="high">

Token refresh failures can strand active reviewer sessions.

</RiskCard>
```

The server registry makes this source importable/exportable, and the client
registry makes it render in `PlanBlockView`. If the block should be generated by
agents, keep `label`, `description`, `placement`, and `empty` precise; those
fields flow into the live block vocabulary.

When overriding an existing block, register the override after the shared
library registration. Last registration wins for both `type` and MDX `tag`.

After adding a block, run focused Plan tests:

```bash
pnpm --filter plan test -- plan-mdx plan-block-registry
```

### Route map

- `app/routes/plans.$id.tsx` — plan editor / review surface
- `app/routes/plans._index.tsx` — plan list
- `app/routes/share.$token.tsx` — public / shared plan view
- `app/routes/local-plans.$slug.tsx` — local-files mode preview

### Local mode (advanced, offline) {#local-mode}

For fully offline, no-account use, you can run the Plans app locally and point it at local MDX folders. For the stricter no-DB path, use [local-files privacy mode](#local-files), which reads from MDX folders instead of creating local SQL rows. Local mode is a separate, advanced path — not the default hosted flow.

## Events and notifications {#events}

The Plan template emits four events on the framework event bus. Any automation
can subscribe to them — no custom integration code needed.

### Event reference {#event-reference}

#### `plan.created`

Fires when a new visual plan or recap is created.

| Field       | Type                  | Description                              |
| ----------- | --------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `planId`    | string                | Unique plan identifier                   |
| `title`     | string                | Plan title                               |

### Automation recipes {#automation-recipes}

These automations are created by asking the plan agent — no code changes needed.
The agent calls `manage-automations` with `action=define`, writes a
`jobs/<name>.md` resource, and the event subscription starts immediately.

#### Notify via webhook when someone comments on a plan

Ask the plan agent:

> "When someone adds a human comment on a plan, POST a message to my webhook."

The agent creates an automation like this:

```yaml
---
triggerType: event
event: plan.commented
condition: "resolutionTarget is human or resolutionTarget is null"
mode: agentic
domain: plan
enabled: true
---
Send a POST request to ${keys.NOTIFY_WEBHOOK} with a JSON body containing:
  - "title": the plan title from the event payload
  - "excerpt": the comment excerpt from the event payload
  - "url": the base app URL concatenated with the path field from the event payload
  - "author": the author field from the event payload (may be null)
```

Before the automation can fire you need to add the webhook URL as an ad-hoc key:

1. Go to **Settings → Keys** and add a key named `NOTIFY_WEBHOOK` with your
   webhook URL (e.g. a Slack incoming webhook, a generic HTTP endpoint, or any
   notification service URL).
2. Optionally set a URL allowlist on the key to restrict which origins it can
   POST to.

The `web-request` tool resolves `${keys.NOTIFY_WEBHOOK}` server-side before
sending — the raw URL never appears in the agent's context.

**To target Slack specifically:** set `NOTIFY_WEBHOOK` to your Slack incoming
webhook URL
(`https://hooks.slack.com/services/…`). The automation body above already
produces a payload Slack's incoming webhook accepts via the `text` or `blocks`
fields — ask the agent to format the body as a Slack message if you want richer
formatting.

#### Wake the coding agent when feedback targets it

For feedback directed at the coding agent (`resolutionTarget === "agent"`), ask:

> "When a plan comment targets the agent, run my coding agent with the plan
> excerpt as context."

```yaml
---
triggerType: event
event: plan.commented
condition: "resolutionTarget is agent"
mode: agentic
domain: plan
enabled: true
---

Use the manage-notifications action or web-request tool to alert the coding agent
that new agent-targeted feedback has arrived on plan ${planId}: "${excerpt}".
Include the plan path so the agent can navigate directly to it.
```

Because the automation runs a full agent loop (`mode: agentic`), it can call
`web-request`, send notifications, or invoke any action the agent has access to.
The exact delivery mechanism depends on what notification channels you have
configured — the agent picks the best available one.
