# Plans

Agent-Native Plans is visual plan mode for coding agents. It turns an ordinary
Codex, Claude Code, Markdown, or pasted implementation plan into a structured
review surface with rich text, diagrams, wireframes, prototypes, implementation
maps, annotations, comments, and shareable links.

## Install the skill

Use the Agent-Native CLI. This is the recommended setup because it installs the
Plans skill instructions, registers the hosted Plans MCP connector, and runs the
client-specific auth/setup flow in one step:

```bash
npx @agent-native/core@latest skills add visual-plan
```

If you already have the CLI installed, the shorter command is equivalent:

```bash
agent-native skills add visual-plan
```

The command installs `/visual-plan` plus the companion commands:

- `/ui-plan` for UI-first plans with mockups, states, and screen-level review.
- `/visual-questions` for visual intake before a plan.
- `/visualize-plan` for turning an existing text plan into a visual companion.

By default the CLI targets Codex. Add `--client claude-code` or `--client all`
when you want to configure another host:

```bash
npx @agent-native/core@latest skills add visual-plan --client all
```

If you only want the portable instruction file through the open Skills CLI, use:

```bash
npx skills add BuilderIO/agent-native --skill visual-plan
```

That installs the skill instructions only. It does not register the hosted MCP
connector, so use the Agent-Native CLI path when you want the one-command setup.

## Use it from your coding agent

After installation, ask your agent for the command that fits the work:

- `/visual-plan` creates a structured plan for architecture, backend, refactor,
  or mixed product work.
- `/ui-plan` creates a UI-first plan with wireframes, mockups, states, and
  implementation notes.
- `/visual-questions` opens a visual intake questionnaire before planning.
- `/visualize-plan` imports a plan you already have and makes it reviewable.

The agent should inspect the codebase first, then create the visual plan when a
wrong direction would be costly. The returned Plans link opens the review UI so
you can annotate, correct, choose options, and ask for updates before code
changes begin.

## What you can do with it

- **Review before implementation.** React to diagrams, wireframes, option tabs,
  risk notes, file maps, and code previews before the agent edits files.
- **Comment directly on the plan.** Pin feedback, request changes, and resolve
  comments as the plan evolves.
- **Share with reviewers.** Hosted Plans can create private review links and
  account-backed sharing. Viewing shared plans works from the browser; saving
  and sharing require sign-in.
- **Export the result.** Keep an HTML, Markdown, or JSON receipt of the plan
  when you need a source-control-friendly handoff.
- **Run locally when needed.** The template can be self-hosted for development
  or offline workflows, while the hosted skill is the easiest path for normal
  coding-agent use.

## Useful prompts

- "Use `/visual-plan` before changing the auth flow."
- "Create a `/ui-plan` for the new onboarding screen with mobile and desktop states."
- "Use `/visual-questions` to help me choose the dashboard direction first."
- "Run `/visualize-plan` on the Markdown plan below and make it easier to review."

## For developers

The rest of this doc is for anyone forking or self-hosting the Plans template.
Most users should install the skill with the CLI instead of scaffolding the app.

### Scaffold the template

```bash
npx @agent-native/core create my-plans --standalone --template plan
cd my-plans
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

The hosted app-backed skill uses:

- App: `https://plan.agent-native.com`
- MCP: `https://plan.agent-native.com/_agent-native/mcp`

The local template is useful when you are developing Plans itself, testing local
persistence, or running a fully self-hosted review surface.
