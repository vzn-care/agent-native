# Assets

Assets is an agent-native workspace for creating and managing brand-consistent media. It organizes uploads and generated results into libraries and folders, lets teams collect examples for blog heroes, diagrams, landing pages, product shots, videos, and logos, then routes generation through the agent chat so every asset can be reviewed and refined.

Use it when your team needs reusable visual direction and searchable source assets instead of one-off generic media prompts.

![Assets library for brand media and generated output](https://cdn.builder.io/api/v1/image/assets%2FYJIGb4i01jvw0SRdL5Bt%2F769092170a14474f998cbca47384f891?format=webp&width=1200)

## Getting started

Live demo: [assets.agent-native.com](https://assets.agent-native.com).

1. **Create a library.** Add the brand, campaign, product, or content stream you
   want to manage.
2. **Upload references.** Add approved logos, product shots, style examples, or
   existing videos so the agent has concrete material to work from.
3. **Generate from chat or a library.** Ask for a hero image, diagram, product
   shot, or video variant. Assets stores the prompt, references, model, status,
   and lineage for review.
4. **Use the asset elsewhere.** Copy the export, embed the picker in another
   app, or let another agent call Assets over A2A.

## Useful prompts

- "Generate three blog hero options using the Acme product screenshots as references."
- "Create a square social image in the launch-campaign style."
- "Find all approved assets for the onboarding redesign."
- "Turn this uploaded diagram into a cleaner product explainer image."
- "Create a video storyboard and save the best frame set to this library."

## What you can do with it

- **Create asset libraries.** Group reference images, videos, canonical logos, style notes, palettes, folders, and generated output by brand, campaign, product, or category.
- **Generate through chat.** The home composer and library Generate controls send the prompt to the agent with `sendToAgentChat()`, so users can inspect variants, give feedback, and iterate.
- **Generate images and videos.** Builder-managed image generation is available when enabled, and Gemini powers video generation plus the manual image fallback.
- **Upload and describe references.** Add images or videos from the library UI or prompt composer attachment button, then search by title, description, alt text, prompt, model, media type, status, role, folder, or collection.
- **Keep a generation audit log.** Every run records prompts, model, aspect ratio, references, source asset, lineage, generated assets, status, errors, and timestamps for later design review.
- **Preserve logo accuracy.** The agent can generate a placeholder area and the server composites the uploaded canonical logo onto the final image instead of relying on the image model to redraw it.
- **Embed as a picker.** Other apps can iframe `/picker` and listen for the `chooseAsset` event from `@agent-native/embedding`, turning Assets into an asset picker/generator for blog editors, site builders, slide decks, and custom apps. The picker also emits the legacy `chooseImage` alias for existing image-only hosts.
- **Install as an app-backed skill.** The `agent-native.app-skill.json` manifest exports an Assets skill plus MCP connector metadata so marketplaces can install the app, its instructions, and its picker together.
- **Serve other agents.** Slides, Design, Content, Mail, and Dispatch can call Assets through A2A to list libraries, generate batches, create videos, refine an asset, fetch exports, and render inline previews where embedding is allowed.

## Using it from your coding agent

Generate and pick brand media without leaving Codex, Claude Code, Claude, or ChatGPT.

1. **Install once.** This adds the skill instructions and registers the hosted MCP connector together:

   ```bash
   npx @agent-native/core@latest skills add assets   # alias: image-generation
   ```

   Default client is `codex`; add `--client claude-code` or `--client all` for others.
   If you only want the portable skill instructions through the Vercel/open
   Skills CLI, use:

   ```bash
   npx skills@latest add BuilderIO/agent-native --skill assets
   ```

   The Vercel/open Skills CLI installs the instruction file only; it does not
   run MCP connector setup. Use the Agent Native CLI path above when you want
   the one-command setup.

2. **Ask for images.** In your agent's chat: "Generate three blog hero options from the Acme product shots." The agent opens the picker with candidate images you can regenerate, retune (prompt, aspect, count), and choose from.
3. **Pick.** In inline hosts (ChatGPT, Claude.ai, Claude Desktop main chat) the picker renders right in the chat — click a candidate and the choice flows back automatically. On CLI/link-only hosts (Codex, Claude Code, Claude Desktop "Code" tab) you get an **"Open in Assets →"** link; open it, pick in the browser, then paste the copied handoff summary back into your chat — or just say "use image A".

   ```text
   Paste this selection back into your chat so the agent can use it.

   Selected Assets image for the next step: <label>
   Media URL: <url>
   Use this selected asset in the current artifact or design.

   Selected asset context:
   { "selectedAsset": { "assetId": "...", "url": "...", "mediaType": "image", ... } }
   ```

4. **Apply to code.** The chosen Media URL and `assetId` come back to the agent, which uses the URL directly in the code it writes (an `<img>` src, a download) or calls `export-asset`.

## For developers

The rest of this doc is for anyone forking the Assets template or extending it.

### Scaffolding

```bash
npx @agent-native/core@latest create my-assets --standalone --template assets
```

### Data model

All data lives in SQL via Drizzle ORM (binary media lives in object storage, or the local file-upload fallback during development). Schema: `templates/assets/server/db/schema.ts`. Libraries carry the standard `ownableColumns` and a matching framework shares table, so they slot into the per-user / per-org sharing model. The SQL table names keep the legacy `image_*` prefix from when the app was called Images.

| Table                            | What it holds                                                                                                                                                                            |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `image_libraries`                | A library — the top-level container grouped by brand, campaign, product, or category. Holds `custom_instructions`, `style_brief`, canonical logo and cover asset refs, and archive state |
| `image_library_shares`           | Framework shares table mapping principals (users or orgs) to roles (viewer, editor, admin) per library                                                                                   |
| `image_collections`              | Style/category groupings inside a library — `style_brief`, `prompt_template`, default aspect ratio and image size                                                                        |
| `asset_folders`                  | Nestable folders inside a library (`parent_id` for hierarchy)                                                                                                                            |
| `image_generation_presets`       | Saved generation recipes — media type, prompt template, aspect ratio, model, and text/reference policy                                                                                   |
| `image_generation_sessions`      | An iterative generate-and-choose session with a brief, status, active asset, and feedback summary                                                                                        |
| `image_generation_session_items` | Candidate assets within a session, each with a role and note                                                                                                                             |
| `image_assets`                   | The asset record — media type, role, status, title/description/alt text, prompt, model, dimensions, MIME type, object/thumbnail keys, and lineage                                        |
| `image_generation_runs`          | The generation audit log — prompt, compiled prompt, model, references, status, errors, and the `source` (`chat` / `ui` / `a2a`) that triggered it                                        |

### Customizing it

Assets is a complete, cloneable template. Some practical extension ideas:

- "Add a product catalog connector so product reference shots can be selected by SKU."
- "Add a strict approval queue before generated assets are marked usable for marketing."
- "Add a brand review dashboard that filters failed or low-rated generations by model."
- "Create a workspace-wide default asset library and route Slides image generation through it."
- "Add a new provider behind the image generation interface after checking the latest provider docs."

The agent edits routes, components, actions, skills, and SQL-backed models as needed. See [Templates](/docs/cloneable-saas) for the full clone, customize, deploy flow, and [A2A Protocol](/docs/a2a-protocol) for cross-app generation.

### Embed the picker

Use the picker route when a human is choosing or generating an asset inside
another product. Image is the default media type; pass `mediaType=video` when
you want video browsing/selection:

```tsx
import { EmbeddedApp } from "@agent-native/embedding";

<EmbeddedApp
  url="https://assets.agent-native.com/picker?mediaType=image"
  onMessage={(name, payload) => {
    if (name === "chooseAsset") {
      insertAsset((payload as { url: string }).url);
    }
  }}
/>;
```

External MCP hosts should call `open-asset-picker` instead of constructing this
iframe by hand. The action returns a browser fallback link and MCP App metadata
for inline hosts. When a user selects an asset, the picker emits `chooseAsset`,
the legacy `chooseImage` alias for image assets, and updates MCP App model
context where the host supports it. When a host opens the fallback link in a
normal browser tab instead of rendering the MCP App inline, selecting an asset
copies a handoff summary and shows a copyable context block; paste that summary
back into the chat so the external agent can use the selected media URL and
asset metadata.

Codex, Claude Code, and Claude Desktop Code should be treated as link-out hosts
for this flow. They may not render MCP Apps inline, and remote CDN markdown
images may not display reliably in the chat transcript. Agents should keep the
asset link as the source of truth; when a visible inline preview is needed in a
code-editor chat, download the selected `previewUrl`/`downloadUrl` to a local
image file and embed that absolute local path.

For generate-and-choose flows, call `open-asset-picker` with `prompt`,
`autoGenerate: true`, and `count: 3` (customizable from 1-6). The picker opens
with candidate images and lets the user adjust count, aspect ratio, or a
generation preset before choosing the final asset URL.

Use A2A when another agent needs to create, search, or export assets without a
human picker UI.

### Developer: distribute the app skill

The Assets app skill has app id `assets` and hosted MCP URL
`https://assets.agent-native.com/_agent-native/mcp`.

```bash
# Easiest hosted install: exported skill instructions plus MCP connector.
npx @agent-native/core@latest skills add assets

# Vercel/open Skills CLI install: exported instructions only, no MCP config.
npx skills@latest add BuilderIO/agent-native --skill assets

# Hosted install: URL-only MCP connector, no shared secrets in skill files.
npx @agent-native/core@latest app-skill ensure --manifest templates/assets/agent-native.app-skill.json

# Local editable launch.
npx @agent-native/core@latest app-skill launch --manifest templates/assets/agent-native.app-skill.json --local --into ./assets-local

# Marketplace package, including Claude Code marketplace and Vercel Labs skills adapters.
npx @agent-native/core@latest app-skill pack --manifest templates/assets/agent-native.app-skill.json --out ./dist/assets-skill

# Install a local exported Assets bundle with the open skills CLI.
npx skills@latest add ./dist/assets-skill --skill assets -a codex -y

# Install from the generated Claude Code marketplace adapter.
claude plugin marketplace add ./dist/assets-skill/adapters/claude-marketplace
claude plugin install agent-native-assets@agent-native-apps
```

The exported skill teaches agents to use the picker for human-in-the-loop
selection, direct actions for unattended image/video generation, and browser
links when inline MCP Apps are unavailable.

The Claude marketplace adapter contains a `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`
catalog and an `agent-native-assets` plugin with `skills/assets/SKILL.md` plus
the hosted `.mcp.json`. In interactive Claude Code, the same flow is available
as `/plugin marketplace add ./dist/assets-skill/adapters/claude-marketplace`,
`/plugin install agent-native-assets@agent-native-apps`, `/reload-plugins`, and
`/mcp` for MCP authentication.

If you install from a raw marketplace bundle with `npx skills@latest`, register the
hosted MCP connector so those instructions can call the live Assets app:

```bash
npx @agent-native/core@latest app-skill ensure --manifest ./dist/assets-skill/agent-native.app-skill.json --yes
```
