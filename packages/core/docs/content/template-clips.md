# Clips

A capture-everything app: screen recordings, meeting notes from your calendar, and Fn-hold voice dictation. The agent transcribes, titles, summarizes, and indexes all of it — then lets you ask "find the clip where we discussed the rollout plan" and searches across every transcript you've ever made.

Think along the lines of Loom + Granola + Wispr Flow rolled into one app — but the agent is a first-class editor across every surface, and the recordings, meetings, and dictations are yours, not a SaaS vendor's.

## What you can do with it

- **Record your screen** with a built-in recorder, webcam overlay, audio capture, and pause/trim.
- **Capture meetings from your calendar.** Connect Google Calendar, see upcoming meetings in the sidebar, and hit record on any one. You get a live transcript plus AI summary, bullet notes, and action items the moment it ends.
- **Push-to-talk dictation.** Hold Fn on your machine, speak, and the cleaned-up text drops into whatever app you're using. Every dictation is kept in a searchable history with originals and AI-cleaned versions side by side.
- **Get an auto-generated title, summary, and chapter markers** for every recording — the agent fills them in and keeps them current.
- **Search across every transcript** — screen recordings, meetings, and dictations all in one library. "Find the clip where we discussed the rollout plan."
- **Share clips** with per-clip permissions (public, team, private). Link tracking and threaded comments work too.
- **Smart library views.** Group by project, filter by speaker, auto-tag based on content.
- **Edit the transcript through chat.** "Fix the mis-transcribed word at 1:42." "Pull three quotes for a blog post." The agent edits the transcript and the UI updates live.

## Getting started

Live demo: [clips.agent-native.com](https://clips.agent-native.com).

1. **Open Library.** Browse screen recordings, meeting recordings, dictations,
   folders, and spaces from one place.
2. **Record or import.** Capture a screen recording, start from a calendar
   meeting, or use push-to-talk dictation.
3. **Let the agent clean it up.** Generate a title, summary, chapters, action
   items, or cleaned-up transcript text.
4. **Search and reuse.** Ask for the clip, quote, action item, or decision you
   need, then share the result with the right visibility.

## Useful Prompts

- "Summarize this clip for a product update."
- "Find the meeting where we discussed the rollout plan."
- "Pull three customer quotes from this transcript."
- "Create action items from the last sales call."
- "Clean up this dictation and turn it into a Linear ticket."

## For developers

The rest of this doc is for anyone forking the Clips template or extending it.

### Scaffolding

```bash
npx @agent-native/core@latest create my-clips --standalone --template clips
cd my-clips
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Clips is a larger template with a native recorder (it ships a desktop companion for local capture). Three setup steps are needed before recordings can upload:

1. **Video storage (required).** Connect a storage backend through the onboarding wizard. The easiest path is Builder.io (free during beta, one-click). For self-hosted storage, set `S3_ENDPOINT`, `S3_BUCKET`, `S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, and optionally `S3_REGION` and `S3_PUBLIC_BASE_URL`. Cloudflare R2 and DigitalOcean Spaces use the same env vars with the `R2_*` prefix.
2. **Google Calendar (optional).** To sync upcoming meetings, connect a Google Calendar account from Settings. The OAuth callback URL in dev is `http://localhost:8094/_agent-native/google/callback`. Set up a Google OAuth client in [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) with the Gmail and Google Calendar APIs enabled.
3. **Screen-capture permissions.** On macOS, grant Screen Recording permission to the browser (or the desktop companion app) in System Settings → Privacy & Security → Screen Recording.

### Data model

All data lives in SQL via Drizzle ORM. Schema: `templates/clips/server/db/schema.ts`. Recordings, meetings, dictations, calendar accounts, and vocabulary all carry the standard `ownableColumns` and have a matching framework shares table, so they slot into the per-user / per-org sharing model.

| Table                                           | What it holds                                                                                                                                                                 |

Recordings and transcripts are intentionally separate tables so the library and transcript views can each render fast. Meetings compose with recordings rather than duplicating media: a meeting owns the recording it captures, but the `recordings` row remains the source of truth for the video and per-segment transcript.

Routes in the UI live under `templates/clips/app/routes/` — the authenticated app sits under `_app.*` (library, spaces, folders, meetings, dictate, insights, trash, settings), with public surfaces at `r.$recordingId`, `share.$shareId`, `embed.$shareId`, and `invite.$token`.

### Key actions

Every agent-callable operation is a TypeScript file in `templates/clips/actions/`, auto-mounted at `POST /_agent-native/actions/:name` and runnable from the CLI as `pnpm action <name>`. There are ~80 actions; the useful groupings:

- **Recording lifecycle** — `create-recording`, `finalize-recording`, `update-recording`, `set-thumbnail`, `archive-recording` / `restore-recording` / `trash-recording` / `delete-recording-permanent`, `move-recording`, `tag-recording`.
- **Transcript & AI** — `request-transcript`, `cleanup-transcript`, `regenerate-title` / `regenerate-summary` / `regenerate-chapters`, `set-chapters`, `generate-workflow`. (`cleanup-transcript` and `finalize-meeting` are server-side media-pipeline calls; most other AI features delegate to the agent chat.)
- **Editing** — non-destructive `trim-recording`, `split-recording`, `remove-filler-words`, `remove-silences`, plus `stitch-recordings`, `undo-edit`, `clear-edits`. Edits accumulate in `edits_json`; the client concatenates/exports via ffmpeg.wasm.
- **Meetings** — `create-meeting`, `start-meeting-recording` / `stop-meeting-recording`, `finalize-meeting`, `update-meeting`, `get-meeting`, `list-meetings`, plus calendar wiring `connect-calendar` / `disconnect-calendar` / `sync-calendars` / `list-calendar-accounts`.
- **Dictation** — `create-dictation`, `cleanup-dictation`, `update-dictation`, `list-dictations`, and `add-vocabulary-term` / `list-vocabulary` for personal vocabulary biasing.
- **Library organization** — `create-space` / `rename-space` / `delete-space`, `add-space-member` / `remove-space-member`, `create-folder` / `rename-folder` / `delete-folder`, `add-recording-to-space`.
- **Sharing, comments & engagement** — framework sharing actions plus `create-cta` / `update-cta` / `delete-cta`, `add-comment` / `reply-to-comment` / `resolve-comment` / `react-to-comment` / `delete-comment`, `react-to-recording`, `list-viewers`.
- **Organizations & members** — `create-organization`, `set-organization-branding`, `invite-member` / `accept-invite` / `decline-invite` / `get-invite`, `remove-member`, `update-member-role`, `list-organization-state`, `list-notifications`.
- **Search, insights & export** — `search-recordings` (matches titles, descriptions, transcript text, and comments, with timestamps), `get-recording-insights`, `get-organization-insights`, `export-insights-csv`, `export-to-brain`.
- **Context & navigation** — `view-screen` (current clip, playhead, selected transcript range) and `navigate`; `refresh-list` after mutations.

### Customizing it

Clips is a complete, cloneable template — fork it and ask the agent to extend it. Some examples:

- "Add a filler-word removal button that strips ums and uhs from the transcript and re-stitches the video."
- "Auto-post my standup notes to Slack #eng whenever a meeting ends." (Connect Slack first via [Messaging](/docs/messaging).)
- "Add a hotkey that drops the last dictation into Linear as a new ticket."
- "Group the library by project — detect the project from the first words of each transcript."
- "Add a 'Generate blog post from this clip' button that drafts a post from the transcript and saves it as a draft."
- "Let viewers leave timestamped reactions on a shared clip."

The agent edits routes, components, the transcript pipeline, and the schema as needed. See [Templates](/docs/cloneable-saas) for the full clone, customize, deploy flow, and [Getting Started](/docs/getting-started) if this is your first agent-native template.

## What's next

- [**Templates**](/docs/cloneable-saas) — the clone-and-own model
- [**Context Awareness**](/docs/context-awareness) — how the agent knows the current clip and playhead
- [**Agent Teams**](/docs/agent-teams) — delegate transcript cleanup to a specialist sub-agent
