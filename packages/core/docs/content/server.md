# Server

Agent-native apps use [Nitro](https://nitro.build) for server routes and plugins. Most product behavior should live in [Actions](/docs/actions); custom routes are for protocol surfaces that actions do not fit: uploads, streaming, public pages, webhooks, OAuth callbacks, and provider-specific APIs.

## File-Based Routes {#file-based-routes}

Routes live in `server/routes/` and Nitro maps filenames to methods and paths:

```text
server/routes/
  api/
    health.get.ts              -> GET  /api/health
    uploads.post.ts            -> POST /api/uploads
    webhooks/
      stripe.post.ts           -> POST /api/webhooks/stripe
  [...page].get.ts             -> SSR catch-all for public pages
```

Each route exports a `defineEventHandler`:

```ts
// server/routes/api/health.get.ts
import { defineEventHandler } from "h3";

export default defineEventHandler(() => ({
  ok: true,
  service: "my-template",
}));
```

### Route naming conventions {#route-naming-conventions}

| File name pattern  | HTTP method | Example path                |
| ------------------ | ----------- | --------------------------- |
| `index.get.ts`     | GET         | `/api/items`                |
| `index.post.ts`    | POST        | `/api/items`                |
| `[id].get.ts`      | GET         | `/api/items/:id`            |
| `[id].patch.ts`    | PATCH       | `/api/items/:id`            |
| `[id].delete.ts`   | DELETE      | `/api/items/:id`            |
| `[...slug].get.ts` | GET         | `/api/items/*` or catch-all |

## Prefer Actions For App Operations {#actions-first}

If the UI and agent both need to do something, define an action instead of a custom API route. Actions automatically become:

- Agent tools.
- Typed frontend hooks.
- HTTP endpoints under `/_agent-native/actions/:name`.
- MCP and A2A-callable tools.
- CLI commands for development.

Use custom `/api/*` routes only when you need a route-shaped protocol or binary/streaming behavior. See [Actions](/docs/actions).

## One-Shot Text Completion {#complete-text}

Most AI work should go through the agent chat so users can see, steer, and audit
what happened. For narrow server-side transforms that intentionally do not need
tools, chat history, or run state, use `completeText()` as an explicit escape
hatch.

```ts
// actions/classify-message.ts
import { defineAction } from "@agent-native/core";
import { completeText } from "@agent-native/core/server";
import { z } from "zod";

export default defineAction({
  description: "Classify a short message",
  schema: z.object({ body: z.string() }),
  run: async ({ body }) => {
    const result = await completeText({
      systemPrompt:
        "Return exactly one label: urgent, follow-up, waiting, or archive.",
      input: body,
      maxOutputTokens: 16,
      temperature: 0,
    });

    return { label: result.text.trim() };
  },
});
```

`completeText()` runs through the same configured engine layer as the agent
chat, including Builder, Anthropic, AI SDK providers, user/app model defaults,
request-scoped secrets, and engine-normalized errors. It is server-only; do not
call model providers from client code. If the operation is user-facing, wrap it
in an action so the UI and agent share the same capability.

## Request Context And Access {#request-context}

Actions mounted by the framework automatically run with request context. Custom routes do not. If a custom route reads or writes ownable resources, load the session and wrap the work:

```ts
import { defineEventHandler, createError } from "h3";
import { getSession, runWithRequestContext } from "@agent-native/core/server";
import { getDb } from "../../db/index.js";
import { accessFilter } from "@agent-native/core/sharing";
import * as schema from "../../db/schema";

export default defineEventHandler(async (event) => {
  const session = await getSession(event);
  if (!session?.email) {
    throw createError({ statusCode: 401, statusMessage: "Unauthorized" });
  }

  return runWithRequestContext(
    { userEmail: session.email, orgId: session.orgId },
    async () => {
      const db = getDb();
      return db
        .select()
        .from(schema.projects)
        .where(accessFilter(schema.projects, schema.projectShares));
    },
  );
});
```

`getDb` is created per app via `createGetDb(schema)` in `server/db/index.ts`, so custom routes import it from the template (`../../db/index.js`), not from `@agent-native/core/db`; see [Database — Where the DB Client Lives](/docs/database#db-client). Do not run unscoped `db.select().from(ownableTable)` in custom routes.

Establishing request context with `session.orgId` is also where multi-tenant policy is enforced on the server. The framework gives you the org identity and the `accessFilter` / `assertAccess` guards; **which** org type or tenant is entitled to a route, and **which** records may cross an org boundary, is application policy you enforce here and in your `authPlugin` — not a framework setting. Keep route-level reads/writes **default-deny** so an app shared across tenants in one workspace never leaks across orgs by accident. For the deployment-shape-vs-policy split, typed orgs, and the entitlement matrix, see [Multi-App Workspaces — Shared apps, tenant-specific apps, and entitlements](/docs/multi-app-workspace#tenant-app-policy).

## Server Plugins {#server-plugins}

Plugins live in `server/plugins/` and run at startup. Use them for migrations, provider setup, recurring jobs, integration adapters, and framework plugin configuration.

```ts
// server/plugins/db.ts
import { runMigrations } from "@agent-native/core/db";

export default runMigrations(
  [
    {
      version: 1,
      sql: `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS projects (
      id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
      title TEXT NOT NULL,
      owner_email TEXT NOT NULL,
      org_id TEXT,
      created_at TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
    )`,
    },
  ],
  { table: "my_app_migrations" },
);
```

Migrations must be additive. Never put destructive SQL in startup plugins.

## Framework-Mounted Routes {#framework-routes}

The framework mounts its own routes under `/_agent-native/`. Treat that namespace as reserved.

| Route prefix                     | Purpose                                                                         |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/_agent-native/actions/:name`   | Action HTTP endpoints                                                           |
| `/_agent-native/agent-chat`      | Agent chat loop                                                                 |
| `/_agent-native/poll`            | SQL-backed UI sync                                                              |
| `/_agent-native/resources/*`     | Workspace resources                                                             |
| `/_agent-native/extensions/*`    | Runtime extensions and extension proxy (legacy alias: `/_agent-native/tools/*`) |
| `/_agent-native/integrations/*`  | Messaging/webhook integrations                                                  |
| `/_agent-native/a2a`             | Agent-to-agent JSON-RPC                                                         |
| `/_agent-native/mcp`             | MCP endpoint                                                                    |
| `/_agent-native/onboarding/*`    | Setup checklist                                                                 |
| `/_agent-native/observability/*` | Traces, feedback, evals, experiments                                            |
| `/_agent-native/file-upload`     | File upload provider endpoint                                                   |

Custom app routes should use `/api/*`, public app paths, or provider-specific callback paths that do not collide with `/_agent-native/`.

## SQL-Backed Sync {#sync}

Agent-native does not rely on filesystem watchers or sticky in-memory state. When actions or framework helpers mutate data, the database sync version increments. The client `useDbSync()` hook polls `/_agent-native/poll` and invalidates React Query caches.

This works across serverless and multi-instance deployments because the database is the coordination point. If you write custom mutations outside actions, use framework helpers or emit the appropriate sync invalidation so open UIs refresh.

## Webhooks {#webhooks}

Inbound webhooks should verify, persist, and return quickly. Long-running agent work should use the integration queue pattern:

1. Verify the platform signature or challenge.
2. Insert durable work into SQL.
3. Self-fire a signed processor route.
4. Return 200 immediately.
5. Let the fresh processor execution run the agent loop and post the result.

Do not rely on unawaited promises after returning a response. See [Messaging](/docs/messaging) for the canonical integration queue.

## Programmatic H3 Servers {#create-server}

For custom packages or tests that need an H3 app directly, `createServer()` returns a preconfigured app and router:

```ts
import { createServer } from "@agent-native/core/server";
import { defineEventHandler } from "h3";

const { app, router } = createServer();

router.get(
  "/api/health",
  defineEventHandler(() => ({ ok: true })),
);
```

Most templates do not need this helper because Nitro file routes and framework plugins handle the app server.

## Production Agent Handler {#agent-handler}

The framework's agent chat plugin mounts the production agent handler for templates. Only call `createProductionAgentHandler()` directly when building a custom server integration outside the standard template plugin stack.

```ts
import { createProductionAgentHandler } from "@agent-native/core/server";

const handler = createProductionAgentHandler({
  scripts,
  systemPrompt: "You are the app agent...",
});
```

Standard templates should customize the agent through `AGENTS.md`, skills, actions, and the agent chat plugin rather than hand-mounting this route.
