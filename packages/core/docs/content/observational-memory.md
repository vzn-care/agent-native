# Observational Memory

A long-running agent thread accumulates a huge transcript: every message, every tool call, every result. Replaying that whole history into the model on each turn is expensive and eventually blows the context window. **Observational Memory (OM)** compacts the older part of a long thread into a dated, layered summary so the model still knows what happened — just at a fraction of the token cost — while the most recent turns stay verbatim.

OM is entirely automatic and owner-scoped. **Short threads are unaffected**: until a thread crosses the first compaction threshold, OM is a no-op and the context is byte-for-byte what it would be without it.

## The three tiers {#tiers}

OM represents a long thread as three layers, from most-distilled to most-recent:

| Tier                    | What it is                                                                                        |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Reflections**         | Highest-level, condensed from the observation log once it grows large. The long-arc summary.      |
| **Observations**        | Dense, dated entries that fold a stretch of raw messages into a compact record of what happened.  |
| **Recent raw messages** | The last N turns, kept **verbatim** — never folded — so the agent always sees the latest context. |

On each turn, the read side assembles these into a single self-labeled `[Observational Memory]` block that replaces the raw older prefix, keeps the recent-raw window intact, and tells the model to treat the compacted record as authoritative (don't redo completed work, trust the recorded decisions, names, dates, and status).

## How compaction runs {#compaction}

Two passes run as a **fire-and-forget, best-effort** step _after_ a clean turn, so they never add latency to the user-visible response and any failure is swallowed:

1. **Observer** — once a thread's _unobserved_ messages exceed the observation token threshold, folds them into a single dense observation entry.
2. **Reflector** — once the persisted observation log itself exceeds the reflection token threshold, condenses the observations into a higher-level reflection.

Both passes no-op below their thresholds, so calling the compactor after every turn is cheap. Because OM replaces the volatile raw prefix with stable compacted text, it also keeps the prompt **cache-stable** across turns of a long thread.

OM data lives in the app's own SQL database, scoped to the owner (and org when present) — the same scoping model as the rest of the framework. It is never shared across users.

## Configuration {#config}

Defaults are conservative. An operator can dial compaction at deploy time with `AGENT_NATIVE_OM_*` environment variables (no redeploy of the app code needed); an invalid or missing value always falls back to the named default.

| Env var                                       | Default | What it controls                                                                       |
| --------------------------------------------- | ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `AGENT_NATIVE_OM_OBSERVATION_TOKEN_THRESHOLD` | `30000` | Unobserved-message tokens that trigger the Observer to fold them into one observation. |
| `AGENT_NATIVE_OM_REFLECTION_TOKEN_THRESHOLD`  | `40000` | Observation-log tokens that trigger the Reflector to condense into a reflection.       |
| `AGENT_NATIVE_OM_RECENT_RAW_MESSAGE_COUNT`    | `12`    | How many of the most-recent messages stay verbatim (never folded into an observation). |

The Observer and Reflector output caps (4000 / 2000 tokens) keep a single compaction pass from itself blowing the budget; they are tunable in code via `resolveObservationalMemoryConfig({ ... })` but not env-exposed.

> [!TIP]
> Lower the thresholds to compact sooner (cheaper long threads, slightly more summarization); raise them to keep more raw history in context before compacting. Set `AGENT_NATIVE_OM_RECENT_RAW_MESSAGE_COUNT` higher if your workflows need a longer verbatim tail.

## When it kicks in {#when}

OM only changes behavior for threads long enough to have produced at least one observation or reflection. Concretely:

- A brand-new or short thread: no OM entries yet → the context is the plain transcript, unchanged.
- A long thread that has crossed the observation threshold: the older prefix is replaced by the compacted `[Observational Memory]` block, the recent-raw tail stays verbatim, and token usage drops substantially.

The injection is best-effort and boundary-safe — if a safe trim point can't be found (e.g. a pending tool-use/result pair sits at the window edge), OM injects the memory block _additively_ without trimming rather than risk dropping a pending tool result.
