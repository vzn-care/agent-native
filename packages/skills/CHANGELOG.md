- Updated dependencies [cb49d6f]
  - @agent-native/core@0.51.14

## 0.2.9

### Patch Changes

- e9709bf: Fix the published skills CLI package metadata so npm installs resolve the shared core dependency from a published package version.

## 0.2.8

### Patch Changes

- 49685d9: Fix the shared skills CLI picker so the standalone skills package installs with
  its matching core runtime, defaults public skills visibly, asks the Plan storage
  mode before client setup, and avoids duplicate Claude Code client choices.
  The hosted Plans option now also calls out that it is 100% free and open
  source.

## 0.2.7

### Patch Changes

  - @agent-native/core@0.51.12

## 0.2.6

### Patch Changes

- 914c8db: Unify the skills CLI flow so `@agent-native/skills` delegates normal user-facing
  list/add flows to the core skills CLI with an expanded public skills catalog,
  while `agent-native skills` keeps the Agent Native-only catalog.

## 0.2.5

### Patch Changes

- 14ea897: Harden local Plan block authoring guidance and align the standalone skills CLI with hosted, local-files, and self-hosted Plan modes.

## 0.2.4

### Patch Changes

- dc1e7a0: Keep generated connect entries on the compact MCP catalog by default.

## 0.2.3

### Patch Changes

- 271e70c: Improve the skills installer UI and managed instruction handling: show Clack
  progress/receipt output, keep user-scoped managed instructions in user config
  files, shorten managed instruction blocks to skill pointers, and forward
  `--no-connect` through delegated installs.

## 0.2.2

### Patch Changes

- 18741fe: Use the Clack-style interactive picker for the standalone skills CLI while keeping the picker populated from the live BuilderIO skills repo, including managed instruction and visual-recap GitHub Action prompts.
- 18741fe: Improve reconnect success output with a clear final status, avoid URL-only Codex config for hosted authenticated MCPs, and keep noninteractive skills installs from downgrading existing bearer-token MCP entries.

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- a784d3c: Keep the default add/list flows and public-repo-backed app skills on the live BuilderIO skills collection instead of delegating them to the app-backed core picker.
- a784d3c: Default app-backed skill setup to all supported clients, clarify Plan MCP auth as per-client, and make reconnect output name which local agent configs were actually refreshed.
- a784d3c: Update user-facing `npx` guidance to recommend explicit `@latest` package invocations.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- d77a37f: Add best-effort install-funnel analytics to both skills CLIs (`npx @agent-native/skills@latest` and `npx @agent-native/core@latest skills`). Each run reports a step-by-step funnel — started, skills prompted, skills selected, clients selected, scope selected, install completed, MCP registered, connect, and completed/failed/cancelled — to the first-party Agent Native Analytics endpoint, so install volume, skill selection, and step-by-step dropoff can be measured. Events carry a stable per-machine install id (unique installs) and a per-run id (dropoff) and never include paths, repo names, or other identifying data. Telemetry is fire-and-forget, flushes before exit, and is opt-out via `DO_NOT_TRACK=1` or `AGENT_NATIVE_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=1`.
- d77a37f: Unify the two skills installers onto one codebase + UX.
  - `npx @agent-native/skills@latest add` / `list` now delegate to `@agent-native/core`'s
    clack-based installer (`runSkills`, newly exported at `@agent-native/core/cli/skills`),
    so the standalone CLI and `agent-native skills` share the exact same interactive
    experience, MCP-server registration, and authentication. A `AGENT_NATIVE_SKILLS_DIRECT`
    env guard keeps core's plain-repo delegation from looping back.
  - `agent-native skills add`: the optional PR Visual Recap GitHub Action is now offered
    **before** any install/registration, with copy that explains it's a GitHub Action and
    what it does. The final summary is rendered with clack (a boxed note + a "✅ All set!"
    outro that points you at the new slash command and a reload).

### Patch Changes

- d77a37f: Long-lived MCP OAuth tokens and lightweight reconnect command.
  - Access tokens are now long-lived (30-day default, env-overridable) with a
    sliding 365-day refresh window, so random 401s after one hour are eliminated.
  - Audience and signing-secret verification tolerances have been tightened to
    prevent spurious auth failures on host-drift or MCP URL variations.
  - `reconnect` command now detects any agent-native MCP config entry whose URL
    ends in `/_agent-native/mcp` for the given host, matching by URL regardless
    of connector name — no more breakage when the entry is named `plan` vs
    `agent-native-plans`.
  - Installs no longer write duplicate alias entries and clean up existing
    duplicates on the next connect or skills-add run.
  - All CLI, server, skill, and docs guidance now uses `npx @agent-native/core@latest reconnect <app-url>`
    as the documented one-line reauth path and consistently teaches that
    reinstalling from scratch is never needed to fix auth.

- d77a37f: Add built-in app connection support, MCP config writers, and install telemetry for the skills CLI.

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- 7ee8be6: Prompt for install scope (project vs user) during interactive installs when
  `--scope`/`-g`/`--project` is not passed, instead of silently defaulting to
  user scope. Explicit flags and non-interactive runs are unchanged.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 3c1d3eb: Add the `@agent-native/skills` installer CLI for plain Codex/Claude skill repos and let `agent-native skills add` delegate public skill repositories like `BuilderIO/skills` to it.
