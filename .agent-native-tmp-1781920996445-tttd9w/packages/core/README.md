# Agent-Native

### Agentic applications you own.

Don't choose between rich user interfaces and autonomous agents. Every Agent-Native app is both.

## Agents and UIs — Fully Connected

The agent and the UI are equal citizens of the same system. Every action works both ways — click it or ask for it.

![Agents and UIs fully connected](https://cdn.builder.io/api/v1/file/assets%2FYJIGb4i01jvw0SRdL5Bt%2Fadc1e9e9368e4a8cb1b4dbb5aae5aaa2)

- **Everything syncs** — Agent and UI share one database and one state. Changes from either side show up instantly on the other.
- **Real-time multiplayer** — Humans and agents collaborate in the same document simultaneously: CRDT merging, live presence (cursors, selection rings, who's on which slide), and the agent as a first-class peer editor. Works on any SQL database and any host, including serverless.
- **Context-aware** — The agent knows what you're looking at. Select text, hit Cmd+I, and tell it what to do.
- **Per-user workspace** — Skills, memory, instructions, sub-agents, and MCP servers — SQL-backed, customizable per user. Claude-Code-level flexibility, SaaS-grade economics.
- **Agents call agents** — Tag another agent from any app. They discover each other over A2A and take action across your stack.
- **Reusable integrations** — Connect a provider once in Dispatch, keep secret values in the vault, then grant apps like Brain, Analytics, Mail, and Dispatch access to the shared account metadata and credential refs.
- **Apps that improve themselves** — Your apps get better on their own. The agent can add features, fix bugs, and refine the UI over time.
- **Any database, any host** — Any SQL database Drizzle supports. Any hosting target Nitro supports. No lock-in.
- **Any AI agent** — Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Pi, OpenCode, GitHub Copilot / VS Code, or Builder.io. Use whichever agent you prefer.

## Try it with a skill

Don't want to scaffold a whole app yet? Add agent-native superpowers to a coding agent you already use — Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Pi, OpenCode, GitHub Copilot / VS Code, and similar agents — with one command:

```bash
npx @agent-native/core@latest skills add visual-plan
```

It installs the skills, writes shared `.agents` skill folders for agents that support them, registers the hosted MCP connector for supported local clients, and signs in the selected client(s) in one step. You get two slash commands that upgrade how your agent plans and reports its work:

- **`/visual-plan`** — before the agent writes code, it opens a structured, reviewable plan document instead of a wall of text: inline diagrams, UI wireframes and prototypes, file-by-file implementation maps, and annotations you can comment on and approve.
- **`/visual-recap`** — after changes land, it turns a PR or git diff into a high-altitude visual recap: schema, API, and file changes rendered as grounded before/after blocks with a shareable review link, instead of scrolling a raw diff.

See the **[Skills Guide](https://agent-native.com/docs/skills-guide#app-backed-skills)** for more skills and local installs.

## Templates

Start from a complete, production-grade SaaS app — cloneable, not scaffolded. Each one replaces tools you're paying for, except you own everything and can customize it however you want. Not demos; products.

Every template is a complete cloneable SaaS — fork it, customize it with the agent, own it. Try them with example data before connecting your own sources.

## Quick Start

```bash
npx @agent-native/core@latest create my-platform
cd my-platform
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

The CLI shows a multi-select picker so you can include as many templates as you want in one workspace. Pick Mail + Calendar + Forms and you get all three apps wired up and sharing auth in one go. Or browse the **[template gallery](https://agent-native.com/templates)** for live demos.

Want a single app, no monorepo? Use `--standalone`:

```bash
npx @agent-native/core@latest create my-app --standalone --template mail
```

## Workspaces (Monorepo)

A workspace is the default shape of an agent-native project. Every app sits under `apps/`, and `packages/shared/` is available for the small amount of code, instructions, skills, or branding that should truly apply to every app.

```
my-platform/
├── package.json                   # declares `agent-native.workspaceCore`
├── pnpm-workspace.yaml
├── .env                           # shared secrets: ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, BUILDER_PRIVATE_KEY, A2A_SECRET, ...
├── packages/
│   └── shared/                    # optional shared custom code
└── apps/
    ├── mail/
    ├── calendar/
    └── forms/
```

Add another app later:

```bash
npx @agent-native/core@latest add-app notes --template content
```

Deploy every app behind one origin:

```bash
npx @agent-native/core@latest deploy
# https://your-agents.com/mail/*       → mail
# https://your-agents.com/calendar/*   → calendar
# https://your-agents.com/forms/*      → forms
```

Same-origin deploy means a **shared login session** across every app and **zero-config cross-app A2A** — tag `@mail` from the calendar's agent chat and it just works (no JWT signing, no CORS).

| **AI**            | Bolted on          | Powerful                | Shallowly connected        | Agent-first, integrated |
| **Customization** | Can't              | Instructions and skills | Full, but high maintenance | Agent modifies the app  |
| **Ownership**     | Rented             | Somewhat yours          | You own the code           | You own the code        |
