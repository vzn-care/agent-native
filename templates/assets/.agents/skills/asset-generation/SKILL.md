# Asset Generation

## Rule

Use the Assets app when a workflow needs reusable brand media, a human picker,
or generated image/video assets that another app can reference by ID and URL.

## Choose The Path

- Use `generate-asset` when a person should get newly generated, on-brand image
  candidates and choose the winner in the inline picker. It matches a library
  when `libraryId` is omitted, generates candidates, returns the picker filtered
  to those run IDs, and works in in-app chat plus external MCP hosts.
- Use `open-asset-picker` when a person should browse, search, or select an
  existing asset inside an embedded picker, or when you want the picker to
  handle generation itself. It still opens `/library` with the iframe/bridge
  contract. The normal human Library workspace is `/library` and `/library/:id`.
  Pass `mediaType: "image"` by default, or `mediaType: "video"` for video
  libraries.
- Use unattended actions when the agent already knows what to do:
  `search-assets`, `list-assets`, `generate-image`, `generate-image-batch`,
  `generate-video`, `refresh-generation-run`, and `export-asset`.
- In chat, consume composer `@` references as structured generation inputs:
  `brand-kit` maps to `libraryId`, `preset` maps to `presetId`, and
  `media-type` chooses image generation versus video generation. If no mention
  is available, use `view-screen`, `list-libraries`, and
  `list-generation-presets` to choose explicit args.
- Use generation presets when the user asks for a repeatable output format
  like social image, blog hero, or diagram. Call `list-generation-presets` for
  the library and pass `presetId` through generation/refinement actions.
- Use generation sessions when another person needs to continue improving a
  candidate. Sessions carry the brief, preset, active asset, feedback, and run
  IDs without requiring the original chat thread.
- Use chat-driven `restyle-image` and `edit-image` for preserving subjects,
  applying library style, and making targeted changes. Do not surface separate
  restyle, edit, or quality-tier buttons in host UIs.
- Use browser/deep-link fallback when the host cannot render MCP Apps inline
  (CLIs and code editors like Claude Code and Codex). Surface the returned
  picker link. When the user opens it, they can either click an asset — the
  page auto-copies a short handoff summary for them to paste back into chat —
  or simply tell you which one in words (e.g. "use image A" / "the second
  one"). Both are first-class; don't insist on the paste-back if they just name
  the pick.

## Image Workflows

1. Read the `creative-context` skill and retrieve visual references separately
   from factual evidence. Respect `contextMode: "off"`, pinned packs, and the
   exact reuse ladder before generation: approved native asset unchanged,
   compose approved pieces, lightly adapt a real example, condition generation
   on narrow references, then net-new only when the relevant corpus is empty.
2. For human-in-the-loop generation, call `generate-asset` first and preserve
   the returned picker/candidate metadata. For unattended generation, pick or
   match the library with `list-libraries` or `match-library`.
   If the user wants a default look rather than a brand library, call
   `list-library-presets` and then `create-library-from-preset`; the resulting
   library is editable and reusable like any other library.
3. For one asset, call `generate-image`; for multiple independent slots, call
   `generate-image-batch` with stable `slotId` values.
4. Image generation actions are synchronous. After `generate-image` or
   `generate-image-batch` returns, use its returned `images` / asset fields
   directly; do not call `get-generation-run`, `refresh-generation-run`, or
   regenerate just to verify image runs.
5. For preset-backed work, pass a mentioned or selected `presetId`; for handoff
   work, pass `sessionId`.
6. Let the server choose a small deterministic reference set unless the user
   named exact assets. Canonical style anchors come from
   `assetLibraries.settings.canonicalStyleAssetIds` and
   `assets.metadata.isStyleAnchor`.
7. Pass `tier: "fast"` for exploration, `tier: "best"` for final/high-value
   output, or `tier: "auto"` when there is no clear preference.
   - Model/ratio compatibility: Gemini image models accept any `aspectRatio`, but
     `gpt-image-2` supports only `1:1`, `2:3`, and `3:2`. When the user needs
     another ratio (16:9, 9:16, 4:5, 21:9, …), pick a Gemini model rather than
     `gpt-image-2` — an unsupported pairing is rejected upstream. Source of truth
     is `supportedAspectRatiosForModel` / `MODEL_ASPECT_RATIOS` in `shared/api.ts`.
8. Preserve returned `assetId`, `runId`, `previewUrl`, and `downloadUrl`.
   Preserve the immutable `contextPackId` and reuse labels on both generation
   run and output-asset metadata; rendered pixels are not provenance.
9. Use `refine-image` for feedback on an existing asset, `edit-image` for
   targeted changes, and `restyle-image` with `subjectAssetId` and
   `styleStrength` for subject-preserving brand restyles.
10. If a designer will take over, call `create-generation-session` or
   `update-generation-session`, then `prepare-generation-session-continuation`
   when they want a chat preloaded with the session context.

For short vague prompts, enhance conservatively with library style context while
preserving the user's original prompt in run metadata. Use
`analyze-collection-style` when a collection needs upgraded vision brand
analysis before generation. Brand QA scoring and best-of-N selection are
deferred.

## Video Workflows

1. Call `generate-video` with `16:9` or `9:16` and relevant image references.
2. Poll `refresh-generation-run` until the run completes and returns a video
   asset.
3. Use `export-asset` when another app needs a download URL or artifact type.

## Cross-App Use

- Hosted default: connect `https://assets.agent-native.com/_agent-native/mcp`.
  Do not put shared secrets in skill files.
- Local customization: run `npx @agent-native/core@latest app-skill launch --local` from the
  Assets app-skill manifest, or pass `--into <path>` for editable source.
- For MCP callers, `generate-asset` is the portable first choice because the
  same MCP App picker renders inline in Agent-Native chat, ChatGPT, and Claude
  when the host supports MCP Apps. Include exact `assetId`, `runId`, media type,
  and URLs in the final response so the caller can attach or embed the media.
  Include `presetId` and `sessionId` when present.

## Don't

- Do not call image/video providers directly from another app.
- Do not treat `images` as the app identity; the app id is `assets`.
- Do not use picker UI for unattended generation when direct actions are enough.
- Do not use copyrighted screenshots or named studio/brand image sets as preset
  references. Use broad textual guidance and user-provided references instead.
