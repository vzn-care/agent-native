# Analytics — Agent Guide

Analytics is an agent-native BI workspace. The agent manages data sources,
queries, dashboards, charts, analyses, and connected warehouse integrations
through actions and SQL-backed state.

Keep this file essential. Querying, dashboard, warehouse, and implementation
details live in `.agents/skills/`.

## Core Rules

- Never hardcode API keys, tokens, webhook URLs, signing secrets, private Builder/internal data, customer data, or credential-looking literals. Use secrets/OAuth/runtime configuration and obvious placeholders in examples.
- Data integrity comes first. Do not invent numbers, dimensions, filters, or
  source semantics. State uncertainty and inspect the source when needed.
- Catalog-first: before querying, consult known data sources (data-source
  status) and the injected `<data-dictionary>` to learn what exists and which
  table/columns/join paths to use. Don't fan out blind queries when the catalog
  already answers where a fact lives.
- Clarify-first for ambiguous ad-hoc work: when the metric definition, date
  range, or grain is ambiguous and a wrong guess would change the numbers, use
  the `ask-question` clarifying tool (multiple-choice) before computing. Ask at
  most once per turn, and never when the dictionary or the user already settled
  it.
- Verify before claiming: only present numbers you actually retrieved from a
  source. Never report a value you did not query.
- The built-in Node Exporter demo dashboard uses the `demo` source. It queries
  the built-in public demo Prometheus endpoint by default, not the user's
  Prometheus credential slot. Treat it as demo-environment data: do not use it
  for `REAL_DATA_REQUIRED`, saved analyses, or real user analytics answers
  unless the user explicitly asks to inspect the demo dashboard.
- Every analytical answer should include enough audit context for the user to
  trust it: source(s), time window, filters, sample size or row count,
  join/match method when relevant, and caveats/gaps.
- Use actions for data sources, queries, charts, dashboards, analyses, and
  sharing. Do not bypass app access checks with raw SQL for ownable resources.
- In dev, call actions with `pnpm action <name>`; in production, call native
  tools. The action schema is authoritative.
- Prefer app query actions and provider readers over hand-written ad hoc SQL
  unless the user explicitly asks for low-level inspection.
- Provider actions are shortcuts, not limits. When a canned action cannot
  express the endpoint, filters, request body, pagination, or API version the
  user needs, call `provider-api-catalog` / `provider-api-docs`, then
  `provider-api-request` against the provider's real HTTP API. The generic
  request action uses the shared `@agent-native/core/provider-api` runtime,
  injects configured credentials, blocks private/internal URLs, and redacts
  secrets.
- For named account/deal deep dives, call `account-deep-dive` first. It bundles
  HubSpot deal/account/contact activity with Gong call detail and compact
  transcript evidence so the final report can match Fusion-style depth.
- For HubSpot deal cohorts, use structured `hubspot-deals` filters for the
  cohort definition: `product` for the `products` field, `pipeline` for deal
  pipeline, `closedStatus` for won/lost/open, and `closedDateFrom` /
  `closedDateTo` for close-date windows. `query` is full-text search across
  deals and is not valid proof that a specific property matched.
- For BigQuery, Prometheus, or other external providers, use the provider skill
  and existing credential/integration flow.
- For questions that span multiple sources, follow `cross-source-analysis`:
  stitch identities on BOTH a stable id AND email, de-duplicate, and cite
  per-source provenance.
- When the user challenges coverage or asks why records are missing, rerun or
  revise from the source cohort and provide the updated answer directly. Do not
  say a revised analysis exists unless you include it or save it.
- Dashboards and charts should be useful, explainable, and scoped to the user's
  question. Avoid decorative metrics.
- For shipped dashboard templates, call `list-dashboard-templates` first, then
  `install-dashboard-template` with the selected `templateId`. Do not recreate a
  catalog template by hand unless the user asks for a custom variant.
- For dashboard edits, default to `mutate-dashboard` with its typed
  `dashboard.*` script API. It supports id-based panel moves, title/SQL/config
  edits, inserts, duplication, removal, and dashboard field patches in one
  atomic save. The main payload is a string, so it avoids native-array
  serialization traps. The script is constrained: only documented dashboard
  method calls with JSON-compatible arguments are parsed; variables, imports,
  loops, functions, network, filesystem, and DB access are not available.
- Do not count shifting `/panels/<index>` values for ordinary dashboard edit
  requests. Use low-level JSON-pointer edits only when explicitly requested.
- `get-sql-dashboard` is compact by default for agents. Use its `panels`
  summaries and `layout.panelOrder` / `layout.firstPanelIds` for orientation and
  proof. Pass `includeConfig: true` only when full panel SQL/config is needed.
- Native dashboards and saved analyses are constrained artifacts. If a requested
  dashboard, analysis surface, visualization, interaction model, custom layout,
  or bespoke workflow cannot be done faithfully with the built-in dashboard JSON
  config/components or saved-analysis markdown/chart format, automatically build
  it as an extension instead and tell the user why.
- Use framework sharing and access helpers for dashboards, analyses, and saved
  resources.
- Dashboard email reports live in SQL via the
  `dashboard-report-subscriptions` actions. They send daily snapshots scoped to
  the exact user/org context that created the subscription with saved URL
  filters; do not hand-wire custom email routes around that action surface.
  Report PNGs are Playwright captures of the real dashboard route in
  `reportScreenshot=1` mode, authenticated by a short-lived embed-session token
  and embedded inline in email with a CID image. Netlify builds emit a scheduled
  trigger plus a background worker from
  `scripts/emit-netlify-dashboard-report-cron.ts`, using a per-deploy internal
  token and disabling the in-process interval scheduler on Netlify to avoid
  duplicate sends. External cron callers can still sweep due reports by POSTing
  `/api/dashboard-reports/run` with
  `Authorization: Bearer $DASHBOARD_REPORTS_CRON_SECRET`. PNG rendering uses
  local Chrome in development and `playwright-core` plus
  `@sparticuz/chromium-min` in serverless runtimes; set
  `DASHBOARD_REPORT_CHROMIUM_PACK_URL` only when overriding the default
  Chromium pack location.

## Application State

- `navigation` exposes current dashboard, analysis, source, chart, and selected
  context.
- `navigate` moves the user to the relevant analytics view, including
  `view="catalog"` for the template catalog and `view="sessions"` for session
  replay.
- Use `view-screen` when the active dashboard/chart context is unclear.

## Session Replay

- `/sessions` lists scoped, signed-in first-party session recordings with an
  email-backed visitor identity and playable replay events. Filters live in the
  URL (`range`, `app`, `q`) and are mirrored through application state so the
  agent sees the same list the user sees.
- `/sessions/:recordingId` loads summary/timeline data through
  `get-session-replay-summary` and fetches rrweb payloads only through scoped
  chunk routes. Do not expose storage/provider URLs, raw chunk table access, or
  unscoped replay blobs in UI, actions, dashboards, docs, or prompts.
- Dashboard rows that include `recording_id` should link to
  `/sessions/:recordingId`; rows that only include `session_id` can link to a
  filtered `/sessions` search.

## Dashboard Template Catalog

- To build or extend a LARGE first-party dashboard, prefer `compose-dashboard`:
  name the metrics and the server generates the validated SQL/config for every
  panel in ONE fast call. Do NOT hand-author big `update-dashboard` configs
  panel-by-panel or loop `update-dashboard` — streaming a giant multi-panel
  argument inside the ~40s budget fails and thrashes. Unknown metric keys are
  skipped and reported; per-panel SQL validates independently; existing
  dashboards append by default (`overwrite: true` replaces). Report the returned
  `panelCount` as proof-of-done.
- `list-dashboard-templates` lists source-controlled dashboard templates with
  `id`, category, data sources, panel count, and installed dashboard IDs.
- `install-dashboard-template` installs a catalog template into normal
  SQL-backed dashboards. Required: `templateId`. Optional: `dashboardId`,
  `name`, `overwrite`, `forceNew`, and `mergePanels`.
- To add a template's panels to an existing dashboard, call
  `install-dashboard-template` with `mergePanels: true` and the existing
  `dashboardId`. It appends only the template panels whose id is not already
  present (preserving existing panels and order) in one atomic save and returns
  `{ addedPanelIds, skippedExistingIds, panelCount }`. Prefer this over looping
  `update-dashboard` to add many panels — sequential calls time out on the ~40s
  hosted run budget.
- Node Exporter ships as `node-exporter-macos` for Darwin/Homebrew
  `node_exporter` scrapes and `node-exporter-full` for the Linux-focused
  Grafana 1860 revision 45 full dashboard converted into native Analytics
  panels. `node-exporter-full` also includes Prometheus Observability Demo app
  metrics (`demo_http_*`, `demo_chaos_mode`, and synthetic CPU/disk/memory
  workload metrics). Keep the first-open `App / Overview` tab light: it should
  show the Request Latency highlight plus current app state, while Traffic,
  Latency, and Workload details stay split across their own `App / *` tabs.

## Demo Dashboard

- `ensure-demo-dashboards` installs one private per-user demo on first app
  open: `demo-node-exporter`. The Analytics root route calls this before
  honoring local last-opened state; when the action creates the demo, the user
  should land directly on the Node Exporter demo's `App / Overview` tab without
  visiting the template catalog or data-source setup.
- The demo dashboard is generated from the same `node-exporter-full` seed as
  the catalog template. Its Prometheus panels keep the same PromQL descriptors
  and use `source: "demo"` so queries route to the demo Prometheus endpoint
  instead of the user's `PROMETHEUS_*` credential slot.
- The demo Prometheus endpoint defaults to the public read-only
  `https://prometheus.agent-native.foo`, so cloud and local MPX installs work
  without user setup. Deployments can override it with
  `ANALYTICS_DEMO_PROMETHEUS_URL` and optional
  `ANALYTICS_DEMO_PROMETHEUS_USERNAME`,
  `ANALYTICS_DEMO_PROMETHEUS_PASSWORD`, or
  `ANALYTICS_DEMO_PROMETHEUS_BEARER_TOKEN`. Do not put credential values in
  source, docs, fixtures, tests, prompts, or dashboard seeds.
- Demo dashboards are ordinary SQL dashboard rows, so rename, share, archive,
  and delete flows apply. Deleted demo IDs are tombstoned in SQL settings and
  are not recreated unless the user explicitly asks to reset demos.
- Use `ensure-demo-dashboards --reset=true` only when the user asks to restore
  a deleted or changed demo dashboard.

## Deep Analysis Rules

**The analytics agent IS Claude with provider access** — the same 200K context
window, the same reasoning capability, plus direct access to BigQuery, Gong,
HubSpot, Pylon, Sentry, Grafana, etc. It can do everything a standalone AI
conversation can do, including reading large unstructured text and producing
long-form memo-style output.

**NEVER suggest the user move to a separate AI tool, project, or external service for:**

- Reasoning or synthesis over data fetched in this session
- Deep analysis across multiple accounts, calls, or data points
- Holding context and judgment across a complex multi-step investigation
- Generating written summaries, memos, findings, or recommendations

### Answer with Real Data

When the user asks a data question, **query real data first**, then present the
answer directly in chat with tables, inline charts, and findings. Never deflect
to "check the dashboard" — actually run the query, get the data, and present it.

### Incident / Metric Investigations

When investigating a production incident, metric anomaly, or performance issue:

1. **Query real metrics FIRST** — Prometheus/Grafana for service metrics, Sentry
   for errors, BigQuery for event trends. Real data tells you what happened.
2. **Check upstream dependencies** — many incidents are caused by provider-side
   degradation (LLM APIs, external services), not local code.
3. **Only analyze code/config after you have data** — code tells you what _could_
   happen; metrics tell you what _did_ happen.

### Batch / Large Fan-Out Analyses

For analyses spanning 30+ accounts, deals, or calls:

1. Define the cohort and chunk into groups of 5-10 items.
2. Process each chunk, writing per-item findings as intermediate notes.
3. Synthesize across all chunks in a final pass.

Do not try to hold 30+ full records in one context pass.

### Corpus-First Provider Analysis

For broad provider searches, cross-source joins, mention counts, classifications,
or questions where absence matters:

1. Inspect the provider catalog/docs when a canned action cannot express the
   exact endpoint, filter, body, or pagination needed.
2. Fetch the full relevant cohort, or an explicit bounded cohort, using
   `provider-api-request` with `fetchAllPages`, `stageAs`, or `saveToFile` when
   the payload is large.
3. Use `run-code` with `providerSearchAll` for broad mention/phrase/term/regex
   searches across transcripts, messages, tickets, issues, notes, events, or
   documents; it preserves provider item IDs, snippets, paths, page/item counts,
   and pagination status. Use `providerFetch`, `appAction`, and
   Resources-backed workspace helpers to join, classify, count, and aggregate
   without flooding chat context. Write temporary files under `scratch/`; write
   durable, user-facing files under a descriptive Resources folder only when
   they should remain visible after the analysis.
   Give durable corpus jobs descriptive, source-neutral names and preserve the
   `jobId`; completed, quota-waiting, and failed jobs are surfaced in the app
   with their coverage counts so the user can resume or inspect the exact run.
4. Report coverage: source, filters, time window, row/record counts, joins,
   failed/aborted pages, truncation, and any remaining gaps.

Never turn sampled records, default limits, truncated excerpts, or aborted tool
calls into a confident "none found", "all records", or exhaustive conclusion.
Recover coverage first, or answer as explicitly partial.

### Learnings Flywheel

After completing any significant analysis, record discoveries to `LEARNINGS.md`
via the `resources` tool (`action: "read"` then `action: "write"`). Capture:

- Confirmed metric definitions
- Provider gotchas discovered
- Schema discoveries (table/column names, join patterns that worked)
- Identity-stitching rules confirmed across sources

The `save-memory` tool works for personal-scope learnings; `LEARNINGS.md` is the
shared team knowledge layer.

## Skills

Read the relevant skill before deeper work:

- `data-querying` for source inspection, SQL/query generation, and result
  handling.
- `cross-source-analysis` for questions that span multiple data sources
  (identity stitching, de-duplication, consolidated provenance). Includes the
  default account deep-dive source order: CRM → support → community → calls →
  product usage → service health → tickets.
- `hubspot` for CRM deals, companies, contacts, tickets, owners, and account
  context. Includes stage-entry date fields and multi-dimensional loss analysis.
- `gong` for call metadata, transcript excerpts, objections, risks, and next
  steps. Includes the two-pass search algorithm and external-monologue pattern.
- `bigquery` for warehouse SQL, data-dictionary-first discipline, table priority
  order, and date-bounding rules.
- `prometheus` for metrics queries and incident investigation pattern.
- `actions` for the shared provider API pattern when a first-class action is too
  narrow for arbitrary authenticated provider HTTP calls and API docs lookup.
- `dashboard-management` for dashboard/chart creation and layout.
- `adhoc-analysis` for one-off analytical answers and batch fan-out pattern.
- `analysis-workspace` for large-scale multi-source analyses: Resources-backed
  files, `scratch/` temporary staging, chunked batch processing with per-item
  memos, `run-code` aggregation, `saveToFile`/`fetchAllPages` for large API
  pulls, and multi-turn synthesis.
  Read this before any analysis spanning 30+ items or requiring data larger
  than one context window.
- `storing-data`, `real-time-sync`, `security`, `actions`, and
  `frontend-design` for framework work.
