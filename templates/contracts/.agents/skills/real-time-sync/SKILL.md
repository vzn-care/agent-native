# Real-Time Sync

## Rule

The UI stays in sync with agent/script changes through `useDbSync()`. In-process writes stream over `/_agent-native/events` first; `/_agent-native/poll` remains the cross-process/serverless fallback. When the agent writes to the database, the UI detects the change and updates automatically — no manual refresh needed.

## Why

The agent modifies data in SQL, but the UI runs in the browser. SSE bridges same-process writes immediately; polling bridges anything SSE cannot see, such as another serverless invocation, cron job, or external script. Every visible write increments a version counter, `useDbSync()` receives the change, and React Query invalidates the relevant caches. This is what makes database writes feel real-time without relying on aggressive polling.

## How It Works

1. **Server** increments a version counter on every database write. In-process events stream through the authenticated `/_agent-native/events` endpoint.

2. **Client** listens for SSE/poll events and updates per-source change counters:

   ```ts
   import { useDbSync } from "@agent-native/core";
   useDbSync({ queryClient });
   ```

   For each non-own event, `useDbSync` bumps a per-source counter (e.g. `dashboards`, `analyses`, `settings`, `action`) and invalidates a small fixed list of framework-internal prefixes (`["action"]`, `["app-state"]`, `["__set_url__"]`, etc.). It does **not** blanket-invalidate templates' own data queries for ordinary domain events — that caused a request storm in production. The exception is `source: "action"`: a successful mutating action is the framework-wide "agent changed app data" signal, so `useDbSync` also refreshes active React Query observers as a compatibility safety net for custom apps that have not yet moved every read to `useActionQuery` or source-versioned query keys.

3. **Templates fold per-source counters into their query keys.** This is the pattern that makes "agent writes show up without a manual refresh" reliable:

   ```ts
   import { useChangeVersion } from "@agent-native/core/client";
   import { useQuery } from "@tanstack/react-query";

   const v = useChangeVersion("dashboards");
   const dashboard = useQuery({
     queryKey: ["dashboard", id, v],
     queryFn: () => fetchDashboard(id),
     placeholderData: (prev) => prev, // no flicker on refetch
   });
   ```

   When the agent writes (`update-dashboard` action → server emits `source: "dashboards"`), the counter advances, the queryKey changes, and React Query refetches that one query. The old data stays on screen during the refetch thanks to `placeholderData`.

   For list/sidebar queries, use the same pattern — pass the counter into the queryKey of every list query you want to keep fresh.

3. **Fallback** polling calls `/_agent-native/poll?since=N`. It runs every 2 seconds until SSE is connected, then relaxes to 15 seconds. If SSE is disabled or unavailable, polling continues at the normal cadence.

4. When the agent writes to the database, the version increments, SSE/polling detects it, and React Query refetches the affected queries.

## Don't

- Don't create manual polling loops — `useDbSync()` handles SSE plus fallback polling
- Don't create your own fetch-based polling alongside `useDbSync` — use the `onEvent` callback for custom handling

## Which sources to depend on

Common sources you'll fold into query keys:

| Source            | Bumped by                                                                   |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `action`          | The agent runner after every successful mutating action tool call           |
| `app-state`       | Writes to `application_state` (navigation, selections, ephemeral UI state)  |
| `settings`        | Writes to the `settings` table                                              |
| `dashboards`      | Dashboard CRUD via `upsertDashboard` / `archiveDashboard` etc.              |
| `analyses`        | Analysis CRUD                                                               |
| `extensions`      | Extension CRUD                                                              |
| `collab`          | Yjs collaborative-doc updates                                               |
| `screen-refresh`  | Explicit `refresh-screen` agent tool call                                   |

If a query reads data the agent can mutate via more than one path, depend on multiple sources with `useChangeVersions`:

```ts
const v = useChangeVersions(["dashboards", "action"]);
useQuery({ queryKey: ["dashboard", id, v], ... });
```

`useChangeVersions` returns a single integer that advances whenever any of the listed sources advance.

## Tuning refetch behavior

To prevent cache thrashing during rapid agent writes, set `staleTime` on your queries:

```ts
useQuery({
  queryKey: ["items"],
  queryFn: fetchItems,
  staleTime: 2000, // don't refetch within 2 seconds
});
```

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom                            | Check                                                                                                          |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| UI not updating after agent writes | Is `useDbSync` called with the correct `queryClient`? Does the affected query have an active observer?         |
| Poll endpoint not responding       | Is `/_agent-native/poll` accessible? Is the server running?                                                    |
| SSE not connecting                 | Is `/_agent-native/events` accessible and authenticated? Polling should still keep the UI fresh as fallback.   |
| High CPU / event storms            | The agent is writing rapidly. Add `staleTime` to queries to debounce refetches.                                |

## Jitter Prevention

When the agent writes to application-state via script helpers (`writeAppState`, `deleteAppState`), the write is automatically tagged with `requestSource: "agent"`. This prevents the UI from overwriting active user edits when it receives the change event.

### How it works

1. **Agent writes** are tagged: the script helpers in `@agent-native/core/application-state` pass `{ requestSource: "agent" }` to the store.
2. **UI writes** are tagged: templates send a per-tab ID via the `X-Request-Source` header on PUT/DELETE requests to application-state endpoints.
3. **Sync filters**: `useDbSync()` accepts an `ignoreSource` option. The UI passes its own tab ID so it ignores events from its own writes — but still picks up events from agents, other tabs, and scripts.

### Template setup

```ts
// app/lib/tab-id.ts
export const TAB_ID = `tab-${Math.random().toString(36).slice(2, 8)}`;

// app/root.tsx
import { TAB_ID } from "@/lib/tab-id";

useDbSync({
  queryClient,
  ignoreSource: TAB_ID,
});
```

The `use-navigation-state.ts` hook sends the same `TAB_ID` in the `X-Request-Source` header when writing navigation state, so the tab that wrote the state does not refetch it.

### Why this matters

Without jitter prevention, a cycle occurs: the UI writes state, sync detects the change, the UI refetches and re-renders, potentially overwriting what the user is actively editing. With `ignoreSource`, the UI only reacts to changes from other sources (agent scripts, other browser tabs, other users).

## Action Routes and Polling

Action routes (`/_agent-native/actions/:name`) work with the same sync system. When a POST/PUT/DELETE action writes to the database, the version counter increments and `useDbSync` picks up the change. Frontend mutations via `useActionMutation` automatically invalidate `["action"]` query keys on success, triggering refetches of `useActionQuery` hooks.

For custom apps, the best out-of-the-box path is:

1. Put read actions in `actions/` with `defineAction({ http: { method: "GET" } })`.
2. Put write actions in `actions/` with the default POST/PUT/DELETE behavior.
3. Call reads from React with `useActionQuery` and writes with `useActionMutation`.

This avoids duplicate `/api/*` JSON CRUD routes and makes agent-created records show up automatically. Raw `useQuery` can still work, but it should include `useChangeVersions(["action", "<domain-source>"])` in the query key for targeted refreshes.

### Auto-emit on mutating actions

The framework emits a poll event with `source: "action"` whenever any non-read-only action runs to completion — whether called via HTTP (`/_agent-native/actions/:name`) or as an agent tool call. Read-only actions (`http: { method: "GET" }` or explicit `readOnly: true`) are skipped.

This means UIs don't need the agent to remember to call `refresh-screen` after every mutation. A listener like this (used in the `macros` template) will refresh after any mutating agent call:

```ts
useDbSync({
  queryClient,
  queryKeys: [],
  ignoreSource: TAB_ID,
  onEvent: (data) => {
    if (data.requestSource === TAB_ID) return;
    // Invalidate all useActionQuery caches so list-*, get-*, etc. refetch
    queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ["action"] });
  },
});
```

`refresh-screen` remains available for unusual cases — e.g. the agent mutated data via a path the framework can't see (external system the app mirrors), or the agent wants to pass a `scope` hint for narrower invalidation.
