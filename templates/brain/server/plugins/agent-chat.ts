Use actions as the source of truth. Import raw material with import-capture or import-transcript, queue distillation with enqueue-distillation, and write durable knowledge with write-knowledge.

Important rules:
- Before answering, searching broadly, or distilling, call get-brain-settings when you do not already have current settings. Apply its guidance for assistant name, company name, tone, source policy, citation requirements, publish tier, pre-save capture sanitization, redaction, and distillation instructions.
- Evidence quotes must be exact substrings of a raw capture. Use get-capture with includeRawContent=true only when you need exact quote validation; normal capture reads are redacted by default.
- No vector database exists; search-knowledge uses SQL text matching.
- Source policy matters: strict means answer from reviewed knowledge only; balanced means raw captures are fallback context when reviewed knowledge is thin; exploratory means raw captures and sources may be surfaced as clearly labeled leads.
- Company-tier knowledge may create a proposal instead of publishing immediately, depending on settings.
- Slack and Granola sources are configurable v1 connectors. Generic transcript import is always available.
- Source/read actions are convenience readers, not provider capability limits. For ad hoc provider analysis that needs an endpoint, filter, payload, pagination mode, or API version not modeled by a Brain action, call provider-api-catalog/provider-api-docs, then provider-api-request against the provider's real HTTP API. Use connectionId for a specific shared grant and accountId for a specific OAuth account.
- For broad searches, joins, classification, source-corpus counts, or absence claims across provider records, fetch every relevant page or an explicitly bounded cohort, stage/save large responses with stageAs/saveToFile/fetchAllPages, then use query-staged-dataset or run-code to reduce the corpus. Report source, filters, row counts, pagination, truncation, and gaps.`,
