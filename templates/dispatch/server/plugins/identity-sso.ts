/**
 * `/_agent-native/identity/authorize` — Dispatch as the cross-app identity
 * AUTHORITY ("Sign in with Agent-Native").
 *
 * Flow (single-endpoint, no code-exchange — see "Why no /token" below):
 *
 *   1. A first-party client app (mail, calendar, …) redirects an
 *      unauthenticated visitor here with:
 *        ?app=<id>&redirect_uri=<https url>&state=<opaque>
 *
 *   2. We validate `redirect_uri` against the strict allowlist
 *      (`isAllowedRedirectUri`). An invalid/forbidden value is rejected
 *      with 400 BEFORE any session work — an attacker-controlled
 *      `redirect_uri` must never receive a token. This is the single most
 *      important control on this endpoint.
 *
 *   3. We resolve the EXISTING Dispatch Better Auth session (`getSession`).
 *      - Not logged in -> 302 to the sign-in href minted by the framework's
 *        `signInJourney`, carrying this authorize path as an opaque
 *        continuation. The framework serves Dispatch's normal login form,
 *        and on success resumes the continuation, re-entering THIS handler
 *        authenticated. No new login UI; we reuse Dispatch's exact
 *        existing auth flow.
 *      - Logged in  -> mint + redirect (step 4).
 *
 *   4. Mint a SHORT-LIVED signed identity JWT using the EXISTING A2A signer
 *      (`signA2AToken`, HS256 over the shared `A2A_SECRET`). Claims are
 *      exactly: sub=email, email, name?, org_domain?, scope:"identity",
 *      aud=redirect_uri, redirect_uri, jti, short exp (<= 5 min). 302 to
 *      `redirect_uri` with the token and the caller's UNTOUCHED `state`
 *      appended as query params.
 *
 * Why no `/token` code-exchange endpoint:
 *   The token is already (a) short-lived (<=2 min exp), (b) signature-
 *   verified against the shared A2A secret, and (c) only ever delivered to
 *   an allowlisted first-party https host. Adding a code + exchange
 *   endpoint would add surface (a second unauthenticated route, a code
 *   store) without changing the trust model, since the redirect target is
 *   already constrained. We therefore sign directly and return via the
 *   redirect query — the simplest secure flow.
 *
 * Replay protection:
 *   The short `exp` (<=2 min) + random `jti` + the caller's `state`
 *   echo-check (the client MUST verify `state` it generated) bound the
 *   replay window. We intentionally do NOT add a Dispatch-side jti store:
 *   the core MCP connect-store jti helpers are not importable from a public
 *   `@agent-native/core` subpath, and a bespoke store would be net-new
 *   surface for a token whose window is already <=2 min and single-origin.
 *   This is documented as the chosen trade-off.
 *
 * Auth-guard reachability:
 *   `/_agent-native/*` is 401'd by the core auth guard when there is no
 *   session, which would break the logged-OUT bounce. So this plugin
 *   registers the exact path `/_agent-native/identity/authorize` as a
 *   `publicPath` via a second `createAuthPlugin({ publicPaths })` call.
 *   When two `createAuthPlugin` calls run in the same server boot on the
 *   same Nitro app, the framework APPENDS publicPaths to the live guard
 *   config (it does not clobber Dispatch's googleOnly/marketing/onboarding
 *   — verified in packages/core/src/server/auth.ts). The path is matched
 *   exactly (or as a `/`-segment prefix), so ONLY the authorize endpoint
 *   becomes public; any future `/_agent-native/identity/*` route stays
 *   protected. The handler then resolves the session ITSELF (exactly the
 *   `/_agent-native/open` pattern) — public-path only means "guard does not
 *   pre-empt", not "no auth": logged-out users are still bounced to login,
 *   and a token is only minted for a real session.
