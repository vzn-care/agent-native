 * Regression guard, mirroring templates/analytics/server/plugins/db.spec.ts.

 * This walks every Drizzle table exported from schema.ts and asserts every
 * declared SQL column name appears somewhere in the migrations source
 * (db.ts) — either in the table's original `CREATE TABLE` or in a later
 * `ADD COLUMN` migration. It can't prove *ordering* (a column could still be
 * referenced only in a comment), but it catches the exact failure mode this
 * guard exists for: a schema column with zero mentions in the migration
 * history, which silently 500s every query touching a pre-existing
 * production table once the column is used.
 *
 * A small number of columns are intentionally NOT asserted here (see
 * `KNOWN_COVERAGE_DRIFT` below) — pre-existing drift unrelated to this
 * change, where `ensureAdditiveColumns` (wired in db.ts below) self-heals the
 * gap at boot instead of a hand-written migration.
