/**
 * Reset chunk scratch space for a recording without aborting the recording
 * itself. Used by the recorder when it needs to discard the chunks it
 * already streamed up (because they're going to be replaced with a
 * compressed blob) — without flipping the row to `failed`, which is what
 * `abort.post.ts` does.
 *
 * Optionally accepts compression metadata in the body — surfaced into
 * `recording-compression-{id}` (a separate sub-key from
 * `recording-upload-{id}`) so:
 *   1. `finalize-recording` can include it in `captureRouteError` extras
 *      (so Sentry tells us originalBytes / compressedBytes / ratio if the
 *      Builder.io upload still fails after compression).
 *   2. The library card can show "Compressed from XXX MB" if we want to
 *      surface that in the UI later.
 *
 * The dedicated sub-key is important: the recorder's own `onChunk`
 * callback overwrites `recording-upload-{id}` whole-cloth on every chunk
 * upload (it's the simplest way to drive the progress poller), so storing
 * compression metadata there would have it clobbered the moment the
 * post-compression re-upload starts. The separate key is read-only from
 * the compression path's perspective.
 *
 * Route: POST /api/uploads/:recordingId/reset-chunks
