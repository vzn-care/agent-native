/**
 * List individual view records for a recording — who viewed it and when,
 * most recent first. Owner-only. This is the per-viewer timeline that backs
 * the "Viewed by" popover on the aggregate view count shown in the library
 * and clip detail insights panel.
 *
 * Distinct from `list-viewers` (aggregate per-viewer watch stats, one row per
 * viewer) — `list-clip-views` is an append-only log of counted-view moments,
 * so a returning viewer's second visit shows up as its own row with its own
 * timestamp.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   pnpm action list-clip-views --recordingId=<id> [--limit=50]
