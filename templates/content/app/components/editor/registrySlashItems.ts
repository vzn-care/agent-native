/**
 * Registry-derived slash command items for content's `SlashCommandMenu`.
 *
 * Every `BlockSpec` whose `placement` includes `"block"` (the shared dev-doc /
 * OpenAPI / structured library plan and content both register) becomes one slash
 * item. Choosing it inserts a `registryBlock` atom node — the SAME core node plan
 * inserts a `planBlock` for — seeded with a fresh `blockId` and the spec's
 * `empty()` data.
 *
 * Content has NO sidecar block store: a registry block's authority is the inline
 * MDX preserved on the node as `__raw` (see `VisualEditor`'s `useRegistryBlockStore`).
 * So instead of seeding a separate side-map entry like plan does, we serialize the
 * spec's `empty()` data to its exact MDX element via the shared core serializer
 * and stamp it onto the node's `__raw`. The side-map's lazy `getBlock` then
 * hydrates the typed `data` from that `__raw` on first render — identical to how
 * a block loaded from a saved document hydrates — and the existing NFM save path
 * persists it verbatim. No new plumbing, byte-identical to a saved block.
 *
 * Notion gating: when `notionCompatibleOnly` is set (the open document is linked
 * to a Notion page), only specs that round-trip to Notion-Flavored Markdown
 * (`spec.notionCompatible`, the single registry-level allowlist from T3) are
 * offered, so authors can't add blocks that would silently drop on push. When it
 * is unset, all registry blocks are offered.
