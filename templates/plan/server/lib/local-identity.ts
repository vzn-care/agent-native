/**
 * Local single-user identity resolution for the no-login local mode.
 *
 * `/visual-plan` is local-first: by default a person creates, edits, and views
 * plans with NO login. Plans persist to the local repo as MDX plus local SQL.
 * Only when they want to SHARE a plan do they make a lazy account and publish
 * the plan to a hosted instance (see `publish-visual-plan`).
 *
 * To make that work, the plan actions must resolve one stable local owner
 * identity for local plan work — even when the browser happens to have a dev
 * auth session. On a hosted/production deployment a missing user must still be
 * rejected.
 *
 * The gating here deliberately mirrors the existing dev-only auth precedents in
 * `@agent-native/core`:
 *   - `packages/core/src/scripts/dev-session.ts` (CLI dev session bootstrap)
 *   - the "latest session" fallback in `packages/core/src/server/agent-chat-plugin.ts`
 *
 * Both refuse to source an unauthenticated identity unless:
 *   - `NODE_ENV !== "production"` (hard refusal in production), AND
 *   - `AUTH_MODE` is unset or === "local" (the dev-only auth shim — any other
 *     value means a real hosted/admin auth mode is in play).
 *
 * We keep the same semantics so the local-mode fallback can NEVER activate on a
 * hosted deploy: a production process always rejects, and a non-local AUTH_MODE
 * always rejects. An optional explicit `PLAN_LOCAL_MODE=1` flag lets a developer
 * force local mode on, but it still cannot override the production refusal.
 *
 * `PLAN_LOCAL_OWNER_EMAIL` may override the synthetic owner in local runtime
 * only. This is useful when pointing localhost at a shared/prod database to
 * inspect private rows owned by the signed-in hosted account.
