# Agent-Native Plan

Agent-Native Plan is structured visual plan mode for coding agents. It turns a
normal Markdown/Codex/Claude Code plan into a visual review surface with
editable rich blocks, diagrams, wireframes, prototype options, annotated code
walkthroughs and file trees, code previews, annotations, share links, feedback,
and HTML export.

## Install

Use the Agent-Native CLI. This is the recommended setup because it installs the
Plan skill instructions, registers the hosted Plan MCP connector, and runs the
client-specific auth/setup flow in one step:

```sh
npx @agent-native/core@latest skills add visual-plan
```

You do not need to wire the MCP server separately.

Supported aliases include:

- `npx @agent-native/core@latest skills add visual-plan`
- `npx @agent-native/core@latest skills add visual-recap`

Restart or reload the host if the tools are not visible immediately.

## Use

It comes down to two commands: `/visual-plan` to plan before the agent builds,
and `/visual-recap` to review a change after it lands.

Type `/visual-plan` when you want a fresh plan before the agent builds, or when
you already have a Codex, Claude Code, Markdown, or pasted plan and want the
agent to preserve it while adding a richer visual review surface.

Type `/visual-recap` when you want a high-level visual code-review recap from a
PR, commit, branch, or git diff. A recap is an aid for review, not a replacement
for reading the actual diff.

Command behavior:

- `/visual-plan` creates a new rich visual plan with docs-level detail, diagrams,
  detailed wireframes/mockups when UI is involved, functional prototypes when
  the interaction feel matters, tradeoffs, open questions, annotated code
  walkthroughs and file trees for code work, code previews, and feedback prompts.
  When an existing plan is provided, it builds from that plan instead of starting
  over.
- `/visual-recap` creates a reverse plan from code that already changed:
  file-tree, diff, data-model, API, and columns blocks that let a
  reviewer scan the shape of a PR before reading line-by-line.

## Normal Planning Flow

`/visual-plan` remains the main planning command. Agents should use their normal
planning flow first: inspect the codebase, gather context, ask clarifying
questions through the host's native ask-user-question tools when needed, then
create the visual plan.

The document should stay close to the Markdown plan a coding agent would
normally produce. Diagrams, wireframes, mockups, and annotations are additive
review aids.

Plans should be visual by default:

- diagrams for architecture, data flow, dependencies, and state machines
- detailed wireframes and quick mockups for UI work, including layout regions,
  controls, states, empty/loading/error paths, and copy placeholders
- tabs for multiple diagrams, wireframes, mockups, and design options so rich
  plans do not become long stacks of visuals
- prototype options when interaction or design direction is uncertain
- annotated code walkthroughs and file trees for code work: files,
  symbols/components/functions, planned changes, concise code snippets, and
  explicit editor-open affordances
- plannotator-style comments, corrections, and annotations
- review prompts for options, open questions, risky assumptions, and choices
- README-like details when helpful: commands, MCP/link fallback, tool behavior,
  data shape, scope, and what is deferred

Review recaps use the same plan surface, but their center of gravity is
before/after review. Use `columns` as the generic side-by-side layout primitive
for structured before/after comparisons, and use split `diff` blocks for literal
code hunks. Use prose beside `data-model` or `api-endpoint` blocks when the
important change is semantic API or schema compatibility.

## Review Loop

1. The agent creates a plan and opens the MCP app inline or as a browser link.
2. The user reacts to visuals instead of reading a wall of Markdown.
3. The user annotates, corrects, chooses options, or asks for a clearer visual.
4. The agent reads structured feedback before editing and updates the plan or
   implementation.
5. The user can keep the plan local or sign in to share a private review link.

Local development can use the framework's auto-created dev account. Hosted
persistence, private sharing, reviewer links, and team feedback use account
login, with Google sign-in available when OAuth env vars are configured.

## Hosted App

The hosted MCP app is expected at:

- App: `https://plan.agent-native.com`
- MCP: `https://plan.agent-native.com/_agent-native/mcp`

The local template remains useful for development and self-hosting.

## PR Visual Recaps

When you install Plans interactively, the CLI asks whether you also want the PR
Visual Recap GitHub Action. You can add it explicitly at any time:

```sh
npx @agent-native/core@latest skills add visual-plan --with-github-action
```

That writes `.github/workflows/pr-visual-recap.yml`. Then run the setup helper to
configure GitHub Actions secrets/variables where possible and print any missing
manual steps:

```sh
npx @agent-native/core@latest recap setup
npx @agent-native/core@latest recap doctor
```

The hosted default needs `PLAN_RECAP_TOKEN` plus `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` for the
default Claude backend. `PLAN_RECAP_APP_URL` is only needed when self-hosting the
Plan app, and Codex users can set `VISUAL_RECAP_AGENT=codex` with
`OPENAI_API_KEY`.

The workflow should treat recap generation as informational only: it can show a
non-required `Visual Recap` check while it runs and update a sticky PR comment
with the recap link, but reviewers still own the real diff review.
