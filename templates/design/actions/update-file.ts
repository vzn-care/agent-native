 * Returns `{ id, updated: true }` on success, matching the pre-existing
 * contract — callers that only check `result.updated === true` see no
 * behavior change.
 *
 * `skippedStaleMirror?: true` is added to the result ONLY in the narrow
 * SQL-mirror-only staleness case: `content` was provided, `syncCollab` was
 * explicitly `false`, a live collaboration document exists for this file,
 * and the caller's `expectedVersionHash` matches NEITHER the live collab
 * text, NOR the `content` being written (an own edit that raced ahead via
 * Yjs), NOR the current SQL mirror content. A caller whose hash matches the
 * current mirror is the mirror column's own lineage (mirror-lineage rescue):
 * it proceeds instead of skipping, advancing the mirror AND diff-merging its
 * content into the live doc.
 * In the genuinely-stale case the content column is intentionally left
 * untouched (the live
 * collab document remains the source of truth) while any `filename`/
 * `fileType` updates in the same call still apply, and the action returns
 * success instead of throwing. The field is omitted (not `false`) in every
 * other case, so existing callers that don't check for it observe no
 * difference. When `expectedVersionHash` is omitted entirely, or the hash
 * matches, or `syncCollab` is left at its default `true`, or no collab state
 * exists yet for the file, this skip path never triggers.
 *
 * Versioned browser saves additionally return `versionHash` for the content
 * that remains persisted. `skippedStaleOperation?: true` means an equal or
 * newer revision from that same browser tab was already accepted, so this
 * late request was treated as an idempotent content no-op.
