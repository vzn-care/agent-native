/**
 * create-fusion-app — start a brand-new full-app (fusion) design.
 *
 * Provisions a Builder Fusion branch (one branch per design) in the
 * configured Builder branch project and hands the user's prompt to the
 * Builder cloud agent to scaffold the app. The branch/container is not
 * necessarily ready immediately — call `sync-fusion-app` to poll the
 * container and pick up the preview URL once it boots.
 *
 * Gated behind the full-app-building runtime feature flag. When Builder is not configured
 * (no credentials or no branch project ID), returns the same graceful
 * `{ status: "not-configured", cta, message }` shape as
 * `migrate-inline-design-to-app` instead of throwing.
