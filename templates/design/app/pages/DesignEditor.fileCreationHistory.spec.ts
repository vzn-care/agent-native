/**
 * DesignEditor.fileCreationHistory.spec.ts
 *
 * Item 1 regression — screen create/duplicate undo destroys its own redo entry.
 *
 * undoFileCreation pushes the just-undone create onto the file-creation REDO
 * stack, then calls performDeleteFiles to soft-delete that same filename.
 * performDeleteFiles used to unconditionally prune the redo stack by filename,
 * which immediately dropped the entry undoFileCreation had just pushed — so
 * redo was ALWAYS empty after undoing a screen create/duplicate.
 *
 * pruneFileCreationHistoryStack captures the filename-keyed prune with an
 * opt-out (`skip`) that undoFileCreation uses on the redo stack. These tests
 * pin the invariant: the redo entry survives an undo, while a direct hard
 * delete still prunes.
