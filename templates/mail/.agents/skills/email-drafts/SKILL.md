# Email Drafts

Create, edit, and manage email drafts. Each draft is stored as an application state entry keyed `compose-{id}`. The UI refreshes through the framework polling/query invalidation path and updates the compose panel automatically.

## Storage

Drafts are stored in the `application_state` SQL table via `writeAppState("compose-{id}", draft)` from `@agent-native/core/application-state`. Each entry is one draft. Multiple drafts can exist simultaneously — they appear as tabs in the compose panel.

## Schema

```json
{
  "id": "abc123",
  "to": "recipient@example.com",
  "cc": "",
  "bcc": "",
  "subject": "Meeting follow-up",
  "body": "Hi team,\n\nThanks for the great discussion today...",
  "mode": "compose",
  "replyToId": "",
  "replyToThreadId": ""
}
```

### Fields

| Field             | Type   | Required | Description                                     |
| ----------------- | ------ | -------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `id`              | string | yes      | Unique draft ID (must match key suffix)         |
| `to`              | string | yes      | Comma-separated recipient email addresses       |
| `cc`              | string | no       | Comma-separated CC addresses                    |
| `bcc`             | string | no       | Comma-separated BCC addresses                   |
| `subject`         | string | yes      | Email subject line                              |
| `body`            | string | yes      | Email body in **markdown** (see formatting below) |
| `mode`            | string | yes      | One of: `"compose"`, `"reply"`, `"forward"`     |
| `replyToId`       | string | no       | Message ID being replied to (for reply/forward) |
| `replyToThreadId` | string | no       | Thread ID for grouping (for reply/forward)      |

## Body Formatting

The `body` field uses **markdown**. The compose editor (TipTap) renders it as rich text, and the send flow converts markdown to HTML before sending via Gmail. Use standard markdown syntax:

- **Links:** `[click here](https://example.com)` — renders as a clickable hyperlink in the sent email
- **Bold:** `**bold text**`
- **Italic:** `*italic text*`
- **Lists:** `- item` (unordered) or `1. item` (ordered)
- **Headings:** `# Heading` (h1–h3)
- **Code:** `` `inline code` `` or fenced code blocks
- **Blockquotes:** `> quoted text`
- **Bare URLs:** `https://example.com` auto-links

Do NOT use raw HTML tags — use markdown only.

## Signature and Style Settings

Before creating or rewriting a draft, read the user's drafting settings with `pnpm action get-mail-settings`.

- Use `signature` exactly when it is configured; do not rewrite or duplicate it.
- If no signature is configured, omit the signature. Never derive one from the user's name, email address, or connected profile.
- Follow `writingStyle` when present.
- Keep generated copy natural and specific. Avoid generic AI email tropes, headings, and over-formal filler unless the user asks for that style.

## How It Works

1. **Write** `writeAppState("compose-{id}", draft)` — the shared application state row changes
2. **UI polling sees the change** — invalidates the `compose-drafts` React Query cache
3. **Compose panel re-renders** — shows the updated draft as a tab, switches to it if new

The compose panel opens automatically when any compose draft exists. When the last draft is deleted, the panel closes.

## Use the `manage-draft` action, not raw `writeAppState`

`manage-draft` is the real action surface for compose drafts (`action`:
`create` | `update` | `delete` | `delete-all`). Prefer it over hand-writing
`compose-{id}` state directly — it does things a raw write will not:

- **Sanitizes the id.** IDs must match `/^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]{1,64}$/`
  (`sanitizeDraftId`); an invalid id on create silently falls back to a
  timestamp-based id instead of failing.
- **Appends the signature automatically on create** via
  `appendSignatureToBody(body, signature)`, reading the configured signature
  from `mail-settings`. This is idempotent (no-ops if the signature text is
  already in the body) and signature-aware of quoted content — it inserts the
  signature before any `— On ... wrote:` or `— Forwarded message —` block, not
  after it. `update` does NOT re-append the signature — only `create` does, so
  edit calls should not need to touch the signature themselves.
- **Returns a `deepLink`** (via `link()`) that opens the exact draft in the
  real Mail compose UI (`embedApp`/`mcpApp` resource with contact autocomplete,
  attachments, and send controls) — surface this link when running outside the
  first-party UI (e.g. from an MCP host).

```bash
pnpm action manage-draft --action=create --to=jane@example.com --subject="Quick question" --body="Hi Jane,\n\nJust wanted to follow up on..."
pnpm action manage-draft --action=update --id=draft1 --body="Hi Jane,\n\nI refined the draft as requested..."
pnpm action manage-draft --action=delete --id=draft1
pnpm action manage-draft --action=delete-all
```

## Listing All Drafts

```bash
pnpm action view-composer
```

Or from code:
```ts
import { listAppState } from "@agent-native/core/application-state";
const drafts = await listAppState("compose-");
```

## Attaching Files

The `send-email` action accepts an optional `attachments` array. Each entry must reference a file that was previously uploaded via the media-upload endpoint (`/api/media/upload`). Pass the server-side `filename` (the key returned by the upload endpoint, e.g. `abc123.pdf`), and optionally `originalName` (display name for the recipient) and `mimeType`. The attachment plumbing resolves the file from `data/uploads/` or from the configured file-storage URL recorded by the upload endpoint, then includes it as a MIME multipart attachment in the outgoing Gmail message. Do not store or paste attachment bytes, base64, or `data:` URLs in draft state/settings; files are never sent speculatively — only attach what the user has explicitly provided and confirmed.

### Local files from an MCP host

A hosted Mail app cannot read a path on the MCP host's local filesystem. Use
`create-attachment-upload` with the file's display name. It returns a
five-minute, owner-bound `uploadUrl`, a `PUT` method, and the attachment handle
Mail expects. From the local host, upload the raw bytes directly:

```bash
curl --fail-with-body --request PUT --header '<Authorization header>' --data-binary @/absolute/path/to/report.pdf '<uploadUrl>'
```

Use the response's `attachment` object in the draft/send request. The upload
Authorization header is a short-lived bearer credential: do not log, persist,
reuse, or share it. Creating or consuming it does not send mail. Keep `send-email` behind its
normal explicit-intent and human-approval gate; for drafting, pass the handle
through `ask_app` or open the returned compose deep link.

Example:
```json
{
  "to": "recipient@example.com",
  "subject": "Q2 Report",
  "body": "Please find the report attached.",
  "attachments": [
    { "filename": "abc123.pdf", "originalName": "Q2-Report.pdf", "mimeType": "application/pdf" }
  ]
}
```

Attachments are resolved eagerly, before Gmail is touched: if any referenced
upload can't be read, `send-email` throws immediately (nothing is sent) rather
than sending a partial message. If you see that error, the fix is re-uploading
via the media endpoint, not retrying the same `filename`.

## What Actually Happens on Send

`send-email` requires explicit user intent to send — it is `needsApproval:
true` and pauses for human approval before the real Gmail call happens. This is
the canonical, intentionally rare use of the human-in-the-loop gate in this
framework. An authenticated A2A caller may carry the user's exact chat
authorization for one matching send; otherwise the loop pauses for approval.
Drafting and queueing are unaffected by the gate.

It branches on whether the user has a connected Google account:

- **Connected:** resolves an access token (refreshing if the account's
  `expiry_date` is within 60s), resolves reply threading (`inReplyTo` /
  `References` headers) by fetching the original message metadata when
  `replyToId` is set, resolves the sender display name via
  `resolveGoogleSenderIdentity` (caching the result), builds the raw MIME
  message, and calls the real Gmail send API.
- **Not connected (no Google account):** synthesizes a fake sent message and
  appends it to the user's `local-emails` setting so the UI still shows a
  "Sent" item — this is a demo/fallback path, not a queued real send. Do not
  tell the user the email left their real inbox in this mode.
- **Open/click tracking:** if `mail-settings.tracking.opens` or `.clicks` is
  enabled, `send-email` rewrites the outgoing body with a tracking pixel and
  per-link click tokens before building the MIME message, and persists the
  token map keyed by the real Gmail message id. `get-tracking --id=<messageId>`
  reads back open count and per-link click stats for a previously sent
  message; it returns `tracked: false` (not an error) for messages that were
  sent before tracking was enabled or when tracking is off.
- Multiple connected Google accounts: `send-email`'s optional `account` param
  picks the sender; when replying, it also tries each connected account until
  one can fetch the original message, and uses that account as the sender if
  `account` wasn't explicit.

## Scheduled Sends

Scheduled sends use job ids prefixed `scheduled-`; `send-scheduled-email-now`
and `cancel-scheduled-email` both strip that prefix internally before looking
up the job — pass the id as shown to the user either way.

## Snippets

`manage-snippets` lists, creates, updates, and deletes saved reply snippets.
Users insert them from the compose slash menu, so a snippet the agent saves
becomes available there immediately.

## Aliases Are Settings-UI Only

Aliases (Settings → Aliases) are managed only through raw `/api/*` routes from
the Settings UI — there is no `manage-aliases` action, so the agent cannot add,
edit, or remove an alias on the user's behalf. Point the user at Settings →
Aliases instead.

## Important Notes

- The `id` field in the JSON MUST match the `{id}` in the key name (`compose-{id}`)
- The UI debounces writes by 300ms — if the user is actively typing, your write will be visible after a brief moment
- Always use valid JSON with proper escaping (especially newlines in body: use `\n`)
- Multiple drafts can exist simultaneously — each appears as a tab in the compose panel
- When the user asks you to "draft" or "compose" an email, write a compose entry — don't use the send API directly
- When the user asks you to "edit" or "improve" a draft, list drafts first, then read and update the relevant one
- **When called from the compose Generate button:** the context tells you which draft to update (e.g. `compose-abc123`). Always update THAT entry — do NOT create a new one with a different ID. Read, modify, and write back to the same key.
- **When drafting from scratch (no compose window open):** create a new entry with any unique ID
