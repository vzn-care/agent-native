# Performance — Keep Loads Fast

## Rule

Treat every list, every read, and every page load as a latency budget. Two
things dominate it: **how much data crosses the wire**, and **how many
round-trips and table scans it takes**. On a hosted/serverless SQL backend each
query is a network round-trip, and an unindexed filter scans the whole — often
shared and growing — table. So default to **projected columns**, **indexed
hot-path queries**, and **parallel/batched** fetches. These rules are
provider-agnostic: they hold on SQLite, Postgres, or any managed SQL backend.

This skill is about the data and load path. See the `storing-data` skill for the schema
and migration mechanics it references, and the `real-time-sync` skill for how updates
already reach the UI without polling.

## 1. Project columns — never `SELECT *` on a list

A list/index query should select only the columns the list actually renders.

- **Never return heavy columns in a list**: large JSON/text blobs such as
  document bodies, rendered HTML, `config`/`layout`/`spec`/`data`/`tracks`,
  tool results, or base64 attachments. Pulling them for every row is the single
  most common cause of a slow list.
- Heavy/full columns belong on the **single-item GET/detail** path only.
- Need a preview from a big column? Select a **truncated substring at the DB**,
  not the whole column — and it stays portable:

  ```ts
  // Drizzle — project, and truncate the heavy column for the preview
  const rows = await db
    .select({
      id: docs.id,
      title: docs.title,
      updatedAt: docs.updatedAt,
      // substr/length work on both SQLite and Postgres
      preview: sql<string>`substr(${docs.content}, 1, 400)`,
    })
    .from(docs)
    .where(accessFilter(docs, docShares))
    .orderBy(desc(docs.updatedAt));
  ```

- After narrowing the projection, update the row mapper and its return type so a
  dropped column is provably unused on the list path. If the list genuinely
  renders a heavy column (a thumbnail, an inline preview the UI shows), keep it —
  don't break behavior to chase a payload win.

## 2. Index the hot paths

Indexes are added through the **versioned migration array** in
`server/plugins/db.ts` as `CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS …` — not through a
schema-level `index()` helper (the framework applies indexes via migrations; see
the `storing-data` skill). Add an index for any column a hot query **filters or sorts**
on. The recurring ones:

- **Ownable tables** → `(owner_email, org_id, <the list's ORDER BY column>)`.
  Access scoping filters by owner/org and lists sort by `updated_at`/`created_at`.
- **Shares tables** (`{resource}_shares`) → `(resource_id, principal_type, principal_id)`.
  Access checks run correlated `EXISTS` subqueries against these on every list.
- **Child / foreign-key columns** used to load children (e.g. `responses.form_id`,
  `comments.parent_id`, an events log's `*_id`) → index the FK, plus its sort
  column when the children are ordered. An unindexed FK means a full scan of the
  child table on every parent open. **A foreign-key reference does not create an
  index automatically** — add it explicitly.
- **Status-filtered lists** → match the real `WHERE`, e.g. `(owner_email, status)`
  or `(status, <sort>)`.

Keep index DDL **dialect-agnostic and idempotent**:

```sql
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS forms_owner_org_updated_idx ON forms (owner_email, org_id, updated_at)
```

No `DESC`, no partial `WHERE`, no provider-specific syntax — it then runs on
SQLite and Postgres alike, is safe to re-run, and applies on next startup.
Indexes mostly bite **as data grows** and on **unbounded child tables** (a
seq-scan of 10 rows is instant; of a shared, ever-growing log it is not), so
index the growing tables first.

## 3. Don't fan out queries — batch and parallelize

- **No N+1.** Never loop issuing one query per item. Load children for many
  parents in one `inArray(child.parentId, ids)` query, then group in memory.
- **Count in SQL** (`count()`), never "select all rows then `.length`".
- **Parallelize independent queries** with `Promise.all` rather than sequential
  `await`s — each `await` is another round-trip.
- Prefer **one composed endpoint** over several dependent calls.

For provider wrappers, inspect the upstream API before building a list-then-
enrich flow. Prefer the richest endpoint that can apply the real filters and
return the needed associations or participants in one paginated operation.
Cursor pagination is already serial; adding a serial detail/enrichment request
to every page doubles its critical path. Exhaustive records belong in corpus
recipes or data programs with explicit coverage, not one agent tool call per
page or item.

First-class provider actions should represent one stable conceptual operation.
Keep arbitrary endpoint, filter, and pagination access in the provider API
substrate; do not turn a convenience action into a capability ceiling or
duplicate the provider transport, auth, quota, and cache implementation.

## 4. Avoid client-side waterfalls

- Don't gate query B on query A's result unless B truly needs it. Fire
  independent `useActionQuery` / `useQuery` hooks **in parallel**; never make the
  loading skeleton wait on a serial chain.
- Load the visible page from one read where possible, and **lazy-load**
  secondary / below-the-fold data after first paint.

## 5. Poll cheaply; compute once

- Updates already reach the UI through the `real-time-sync` skill (`useDbSync` / SSE).
  Don't add an aggressive `refetchInterval` that re-runs a heavy list/read every
  couple of seconds. If you must poll, use a **wide interval** and a **cheap**
  endpoint.
- **Never do expensive per-request work on a read that runs on every load/poll**:
  re-rendering HTML/markdown, pretty-printing, re-parsing / migrating /
  normalizing / sanitizing stored JSON. Do that work at **write time** (store the
  result) or compute it **lazily only for the caller that needs it**. Reads on
  the hot path must be cheap.
- Data the UI doesn't display (export formats, alternate renderings) belongs in a
  separate on-demand action, not baked into the hot read.

## 6. SSR shell caching — load-bearing, do not undo

Every SSR HTML page and React Router `.data` response is one impersonal,
public shell, hard-cached at the CDN and served identically to every visitor —
logged in or not. This is the single biggest lever on first-response latency:
one shared cache entry serves the whole site instead of a per-user render on
every request. Adding `private`, `no-store`, `Vary: Cookie`, a session read, or
an auth branch to the SSR path defeats the cache for **every visitor**, not
just one.

If you're debugging a slow first response, check whether something
re-personalized the shell before concluding the render itself is slow — the
fix is client-side data loading after the shell paints, never per-user SSR.
See the `authentication` skill for the full model and `guard:ssr-cache-shell`
plus `ssr-handler.spec.ts` (`packages/core/src/server/ssr-handler.ts`) for the
enforced contract.

**Never route mutation-fresh reads through SSR loader data.** Data that changes
when a user acts belongs in an action, read from the client with
`useActionQuery` / `useActionMutation` and kept live by `useDbSync()` polling —
that path never touches the SSR shell cache. A `useRevalidator()` after a
mutation re-fetches `.data` with a plain GET and can legitimately be served the
cached copy. SSR loaders render the public shell; the client resolves anything
that must be fresh.

The one supported knob is the deployment-wide `AGENT_NATIVE_SSR_CACHE` env var:
unset/`on` keeps the default, `off` sends `no-store`, and a duration such as
`30s` / `5m` shortens freshness. It is for deployments whose host does not purge
its CDN on deploy, or whose loaders genuinely serve mutable public data. It
changes cache duration only — cookies are still stripped before render, so
turning it off does not make SSR personalized. There is deliberately no
per-route or per-request override; that is how one visitor's payload lands in
another visitor's shared CDN entry.

## 7. Big payloads and long lists

- **Paginate or window** unbounded lists (messages, responses, events, activity).
  Don't load the entire history on open; load a recent window and fetch older on
  demand.
- Don't store **unbounded blobs inline** in a row that a list/load pulls.
  Reference large content separately so opening the parent stays cheap.
- Never inline binary payloads in columns a list, poll, or `view-screen` summary
  reads. Images, PDFs, audio/video, archives, screenshots, and base64
  attachments belong in file/blob storage; SQL rows should hold URLs, asset ids,
  storage keys, or opaque blob refs.
- **Virtualize** very long rendered lists on the client so off-screen rows aren't
  parsed/rendered every update.

## Checklist — run before shipping a list/read or a new table

- [ ] List selects only displayed columns; heavy blobs excluded or `substr`-truncated.
- [ ] Every hot-path `WHERE` / `ORDER BY` column is indexed (owner/org/sort,
      shares `resource_id`, child FKs, status filters) via a `db.ts` migration.
- [ ] No N+1; independent queries parallelized; counts via SQL `count()`.
- [ ] Client fires independent queries in parallel, not a waterfall.
- [ ] No heavy recompute on every read; no aggressive polling of heavy endpoints.
- [ ] Unbounded lists are paginated/windowed; large blobs aren't inlined on the hot path.
- [ ] SSR HTML/`.data` path stays session-blind and cacheable — no `private`,
      `no-store`, `Vary: Cookie`, or auth branch added to it.
- [ ] Mutation-fresh reads go through actions + `useActionQuery`, not SSR loader
      data.
