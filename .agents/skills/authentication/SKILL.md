# Authentication

## Rule

Auth is powered by **Better Auth** with account-first design. Every new user creates an account on first visit. Use `getSession(event)` to authenticate custom routes; actions are auto-protected. Normal app HTML and React Router page-data responses are one impersonal, public-cacheable shell for every visitor. The client decides whether to render private UI or redirect to sign-in.

## Auth Modes

| Mode                      | Behavior                                                                                                                                 |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Development (default)** | Real Better Auth — same flow as production. There is **no auth bypass**. On first run the framework auto-creates a throwaway dev account and signs you in without printing its credentials (disable with `AGENT_NATIVE_DISABLE_AUTO_DEV_ACCOUNT=1`), so you are not stuck at a login wall. `getSession()` returns the signed-in user or `null` — it never falls back to a sentinel identity. |
| **Production (default)**  | Better Auth with email/password + social providers (Google, GitHub). Organizations built in.                                             |
| **`AUTH_MODE=local`**     | **Not** a browser auth bypass, and never returns `local@localhost`. It only affects CLI/agent identity: it lets `pnpm action` / the local agent loop auto-bind to the single real signed-in dev user from the `sessions` table (see `scripts/dev-session.ts`). Browser login is unchanged. |
| **`AUTH_SKIP_EMAIL_VERIFICATION=1`** | QA/preview escape hatch for real email/password accounts. Signup skips email verification and does not send the signup verification email. Local dev/test skips verification by default; set `AUTH_SKIP_EMAIL_VERIFICATION=0` only when testing verification itself. Use `+qa` emails for test accounts. |
| **`AUTH_DISABLED=true`** | Skip login/signup entirely — every request runs as `dev@local.test`. For local dev, cloud previews, and internal demos only; not for production with real users. |
| **`ACCESS_TOKEN` / `ACCESS_TOKENS`** | Static bearer fallback for MCP/connect clients that cannot use OAuth. Not browser auth and never a token login page.         |
| **Custom**                | Pass your own `getSession` to `autoMountAuth(app, { getSession })`.                                                                     |

> **Never** use `local@localhost` as a fallback identity in app code
> (`getRequestUserEmail() ?? "local@localhost"`, `session?.email ?? "local@localhost"`,
> etc.). There is no dev auth shim. That pattern pools every unauthenticated
> request into one shared tenant and caused the 2026-04-29 credentials leak.
> When there is no session, **throw or return 401** — never substitute a
> sentinel. Enforced by `scripts/guard-no-localhost-fallback.mjs`.

## Remote MCP OAuth

Every app's `/mcp` endpoint is also a standard protected MCP
resource. OAuth-capable hosts connect with the remote MCP URL only, receive a
`WWW-Authenticate` challenge, discover `/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource`
and `/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server`, dynamically register a public
client, and complete authorization-code + PKCE at
`/mcp/oauth/authorize` / `/mcp/oauth/token`.
Access tokens are audience-bound to the exact MCP URL and carry user/org
identity plus `mcp:read`, `mcp:write`, `mcp:apps`, and/or `offline_access`;
advertising `offline_access` lets hosts such as ChatGPT retain refresh access.
Refresh tokens are stored hashed and rotate. Keep `ACCESS_TOKEN` and `pnpm exec agent-native connect` for
local stdio proxying and fallback clients. The CLI
uses the OAuth-native URL-only entry for Claude Code/Claude Code CLI by
default; use the Connect page or `npx @agent-native/core@latest connect --token <token>` when a
client needs explicit bearer headers.

## Local → Real Account Migration

Upgrading from `local@localhost` to a real account preserves SQL-backed workspace data. The built-in migration moves `application_state`, user-scoped `settings`, `oauth_tokens`, and any template table that uses `owner_email`.

Templates with legacy global settings can provide `POST /api/local-migration` for one-time re-homing during the upgrade flow.

## Organizations

Organizations are **framework-managed**, not handled by Better Auth's organization plugin (which is intentionally NOT registered). Org data lives in the framework's own `organizations`, `org_members`, and `org_invitations` tables. Every app supports creating orgs, inviting members, and role-based access (owner/admin/member).

The active org flows automatically: `session.orgId` — resolved by `getOrgContext` from `org_members` plus the user's `active-org-id` setting (_not_ from a Better Auth session field) — → `AGENT_ORG_ID` → SQL scoping (see `security` skill).

When an authenticated user has no org memberships, the framework auto-creates a
default org (named after the user) the first time `getOrgContext` runs. This
keeps org-scoped templates from showing a manual "create organization" step.
The auto-create path skips users with pending invites or a matching
`allowed_domain` org so they can join the intended team instead. Set
`AUTO_CREATE_DEFAULT_ORG=0` only for deployments that intentionally want manual
org creation.

### Stop And Confirm Before Creating Or Switching Organizations

Vault credentials are scoped per organization and are **not** shared between
them. A second organization therefore orphans every key synced under the first,
and the only symptom is a missing-credential error somewhere else entirely,
naming the key rather than the org change that caused it.

So: **do not create an organization, repoint anyone's `active-org-id`, or
migrate a user/roster/identity list into a new organization on your own
initiative.** Stop, say plainly that it will orphan the existing organization's
credentials, and get an explicit yes first — even when the user asked for
something that seems to imply it ("use the real org user list", "align this to
the Settings team view", "migrate my users").

The intended pattern is **one organization per workspace**, with every app
sharing it. When a request needs real org members, add them to the existing
organization; never provision a parallel one per app. `createOrganization()`
logs a loud warning when it creates an additional org for an account that
already belongs to one, and `setActiveOrgId()` logs one whenever it moves an
account from one org to another, naming both orgs and the orphaned credentials.
Treat either warning as a bug report against your own change, not as noise.

Write `active-org-id` only through `setActiveOrgId(email, orgId, reason)` from
`@agent-native/core` (`src/org/active-org.ts`). Calling `putUserSetting(email,
"active-org-id", ...)` directly is how a roster migration silently repointed 21
accounts with nothing in the logs; the helper exists so that cannot happen
again.

Do not wrap normal app shells in `<RequireActiveOrg>` just to force setup. Use
non-blocking org UI such as `InvitationBanner`, `OrgSwitcher`, and a `/team`
route so users can accept invites, join domain-matched teams, or switch orgs
without blocking the primary product experience. Place org UI inside the agent
sidebar so the setup
checklist, chat, and CLI stay usable during setup.

## A2A Identity

Set `A2A_SECRET` (same value) on all apps that must verify each other's identity.

- Outbound A2A calls are signed with JWTs
- Inbound calls are verified cryptographically
- Without `A2A_SECRET`, A2A calls are unauthenticated (fine for local dev)

## Cross-App SSO (Dispatch identity hub)

Each hosted `*.agent-native.com` app has its **own user store**, so "sign in once" is identity federation, not a shared cookie. **Dispatch is the identity authority.**

- **Opt-in per app via one env var:** set `AGENT_NATIVE_IDENTITY_HUB_URL=https://dispatch.agent-native.com` and the app shows a "Sign in with Agent-Native" option. **Unset = zero behavior change** — the whole path is dormant. Reversible at any time.
- **Flow:** app → `GET <hub>/_agent-native/identity/authorize?app=&redirect_uri=&state=` → user logs in at Dispatch → 302 back with a short-lived (`≤5min`) `A2A_SECRET`-signed identity JWT (`sub`/`email`/`name`/`org_domain`/`scope:"identity"`). Strict `redirect_uri` allowlist (`*.agent-native.com` + localhost). App verifies the token, **JIT-links strictly by verified email** (existing same-email user → reused unchanged; new email → created), then mints a normal local session.
- **Invariant (do not break):** identity rows are only ever **added** — never modified, renamed, or deleted. Enabling SSO logs users out, but they always log back into the **same email-matched account with data intact**. Email is the only thing that crosses the trust boundary; the app never trusts a user id, role, or org from the wire.
- **Canary rollout:** deploy with the env unset everywhere (no-op) → set it on **one** app (mail) only → verify (logout → SSO → Dispatch → back to the same pre-existing account, data intact, direct logins still work) → expand app-by-app → rollback = unset the env on that app's deploy (instant, no data change).

## Builder Browser Access

Apps can connect to Builder via the `cli-auth` flow and persist shared browser credentials in `.env`. Agents then use the built-in `get-browser-connection` tool to provision a real browser session via AI Services.

## Protecting Custom Routes

Actions are auto-protected. Do not create custom `/api/` routes for normal
CRUD, data queries, or action-backed operations; use `defineAction` and the
auto-mounted action endpoint instead. If a route-only concern forces a custom
route:

```ts
import { getSession } from "@agent-native/core/server";

export default defineEventHandler(async (event) => {
  const session = await getSession(event);
  if (!session) throw createError({ statusCode: 401 });
  // ...
});
```

Never create unprotected routes that modify data.

## Sign-In from a Public Page

For public pages (share links, embeds, marketing pages) that need anonymous viewers to sign in and return to where they were, navigate them through the framework's sign-in entry point — never roll your own:

```ts
const ret = window.location.pathname + window.location.search;
window.location.href =
  "/_agent-native/sign-in?return=" + encodeURIComponent(ret);
```

After successful sign-in (token / email-password / Google OAuth), the framework redirects to `return`. The path is validated as same-origin via the URL parser — open-redirect / header-injection inputs fall back to `/`.

Bookmarked private paths work through the client session gate: the shared shell hydrates, `AppProviders` redirects the signed-out visitor to the framework sign-in entrypoint with the current path as `return`, and successful sign-in sends them back.

## Gating the App Shell (avoid the logged-out infinite spinner)

Normal app HTML and React Router page-data responses deliberately bypass the
server session guard. They are rendered impersonally and cached as one shared,
public, hard-cached-at-the-CDN shell; APIs, actions, and framework data routes
remain server-protected. The client session gate is therefore the
authoritative decision point for whether private app UI renders.

**Never**, on the SSR HTML/`.data` path: set `private`, `no-store`, or
`Vary: Cookie`; call `getSession` or read cookies in the SSR route or the
login HTML path; or embed tokens/secrets into the rendered HTML — a
token-bearing page still returns the same anonymous shell and resolves access
client-side. This has regressed repeatedly (agents "fixing" it back to
per-user SSR); it is enforced by `guard:ssr-cache-shell` and
`ssr-handler.spec.ts` (`packages/core/src/server/ssr-handler.ts`), and reverts
will be rejected.

`AppProviders` applies `RequireSession` automatically on its private branch. It
resolves the session on the client and redirects signed-out visitors to
`/_agent-native/sign-in?return=…` before mounting the routed shell:

```tsx
import { AppProviders } from "@agent-native/core/client/hooks";

<AppProviders queryClient={queryClient}>
  <AppLayout>
    <Outlet />
  </AppLayout>
</AppProviders>;
```

- Keep the layout/outlet and always-mounted effects (poll, automation trigger)
  inside `AppProviders` so they do not fire 401s before the gate resolves.
- Pass `sessionBypass` to `AppProviders` only for a private-looking surface that
  authenticates by another mechanism (for example, an embed iframe carrying
  its own scoped token).
- Pass `isPublicPath` for public/anonymous and SEO routes. That branch does not
  mount `RequireSession` and SSRs real content.
- Use `RequireSession` directly only when a nested subtree needs custom
  `redirect={false}` / `signedOut` behavior.
