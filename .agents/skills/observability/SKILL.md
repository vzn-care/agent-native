# Agent Observability

## Rule

The observability system auto-instruments every agent run with zero configuration. Traces, automated evals, and feedback collection work out of the box. All data lives in the app's own SQL database — no external services required. Templates can optionally export to Langfuse, Datadog, or any OTel-compatible platform.

## Five Pillars

### 1. Traces

Every `runAgentLoop()` call is automatically instrumented via `instrumentAgentLoop()` in `packages/core/src/observability/traces.ts`. It captures:

- **agent_run** span — top-level parent with total duration and cost
- **llm_call** span — model name, token counts (input, output, cache read/write), cost
- **tool_call** spans — one per action invocation, with duration and success/error

Content (prompts, tool args, tool results) is **redacted by default**. Opt in via the `observability-config` settings key:

```ts
await putSetting("observability-config", {
  enabled: true,
  capturePrompts: false,
  captureToolArgs: true,    // capture action input args
  captureToolResults: false, // include failed tool error text on tracked $ai_generation tool call entries
  evalSampleRate: 0.05,     // 5% of runs get LLM-as-judge eval
  inferredSentimentEnabled: false,
  inferredSentimentSampleRate: 0,
  inferredSentimentModel: "gpt-5-6-luna",
});
```

#### Optional inferred sentiment

Self-hosted apps default to no inferred sentiment. First-party apps hosted on
`agent-native.com` automatically classify 100% of eligible user replies with
`gpt-5-6-luna`; an explicit stored `inferredSentimentEnabled: false` remains an
opt-out. Deployment overrides are `AGENT_NATIVE_INFERRED_SENTIMENT=on|off`,
`AGENT_NATIVE_INFERRED_SENTIMENT_SAMPLE_RATE=0..1`, and
`AGENT_NATIVE_INFERRED_SENTIMENT_MODEL=<model>`; `off` is always the emergency
kill switch.

Classification uses only the original visible user text, capped at 2,000
characters, with no tools, temperature 0, an eight-token output, and a five
second timeout. It skips attachment-only turns, internal continuations, chained
background chunks, and first turns that have no preceding response to
attribute. The managed Builder engine runs the classifier after the main
response has streamed, so it does not contend with the user's response.

Successful classifications emit a content-free `$ai_sentiment` tracking event:

- `sentiment`: `positive`, `negative`, or `neutral`
- `method`: `llm`
- `model` / `$ai_model`: model that generated the preceding assistant response
- `run_id` / `$ai_trace_id`: preceding response run
- `thread_id` / `$ai_session_id`: conversation
- `classification_trigger_run_id`: run started by the classified user reply
- `classifier_model` and `classifier_engine`: classifier attribution

No raw message, prompt, or response text is persisted or tracked.

### 2. Feedback

**Explicit** — `ThumbsFeedback` component renders inline thumbs up/down on every agent message in the chat UI. Thumbs down opens a category popover (Inaccurate, Not helpful, Wrong tool, Too slow). Already wired into `AssistantChat.tsx` via `React.lazy`.

**Implicit** — `computeSatisfactionScore(threadId)` computes a Frustration Index (0-100) from conversation signals:
- Rephrasing detection (weight 30): consecutive similar user messages
- Abandonment (weight 20): session ends shortly after agent response
- Sentiment (weight 15): negative language patterns
- Length trend (weight 15): declining message lengths
- Retry patterns (weight 20): "try again", "no that's wrong"

Score interpretation: 0-20 healthy, 20-40 friction, 40-60 dissatisfied, 60+ broken.

Satisfaction scoring fires automatically after each feedback POST with a threadId.

### 3. Evals

Three layers, configured via `evalSampleRate` in the observability config:

**Automated (every run):** Deterministic scorers that run after every traced run:
- `tool_success_rate` — % of tool calls without errors
- `step_efficiency` — 1.0 for no-tool runs; penalizes excessive LLM iterations for tool-using runs
- `latency_score` — normalized against 10s/tool baseline
- `cost_efficiency` — normalized against 50 centicents/tool baseline
- `error_recovery` — 1.0 if the run recovered from tool errors or had none

**LLM-as-judge (sampled):** Runs on `evalSampleRate` fraction of runs. Calls the configured engine with a judge prompt that scores against custom criteria.

**Dataset evaluation:** `runDatasetEval(datasetId)` runs a golden dataset through the agent and scores each case.

Custom criteria use natural language rubrics:
```ts
const criteria: EvalCriteria = {
  name: "helpfulness",
  description: "Was the response helpful and complete?",
  rubric: "0.0 = completely unhelpful, 0.5 = partially helpful, 1.0 = fully resolved the user's need",
};
```

#### Evals (CI gate)

The three layers above score *real production runs* after the fact. For an active, deterministic gate, use the first-class `*.eval.ts` primitive from `@agent-native/core/eval` (source: `packages/core/src/eval/*`). It runs the actual agent loop against fixed inputs and exits non-zero below threshold, so it gates CI/deploys.

```ts
// evals/faq.eval.ts
import { defineEval, contains, llmJudge } from "@agent-native/core/eval";

export default defineEval({
  name: "answers the FAQ",
  input: { prompt: "What is your return policy?" },
  threshold: 0.7,
  scorers: [contains("30 days"), llmJudge({ criteria: "accuracy" })],
});
```

- Built-in scorers: `exactMatch` / `contains` / `usesTool` (pure JS) and `llmJudge` (provider-agnostic judge).
- Custom scorers: `createScorer` with the 4-step `preprocess → analyze → generateScore → generateReason` pipeline (only `generateScore` is required).
- Run as a gate: `agent-native eval [pattern] [--json] [--threshold N]` — discovers `**/*.eval.ts` and `evals/*.ts`, runs the agent, and exits non-zero if any eval is below its threshold. An app with no eval files exits `0`. Complements (does not replace) the post-hoc scoring in `evals.ts`. See the Evals doc.

### 4. Experiments

A/B testing with sticky user-level assignment:

```ts
import { insertExperiment, updateExperiment } from "@agent-native/core/observability";

const exp = {
  id: crypto.randomUUID(),
  name: "sonnet-vs-haiku",
  status: "draft" as const,
  variants: [
    { id: "control", weight: 50, config: { model: "claude-sonnet-4-6" } },
    { id: "treatment", weight: 50, config: { model: "claude-haiku-4-5-20251001" } },
  ],
  metrics: ["cost", "latency", "satisfaction"],
  assignmentLevel: "user" as const,
  startedAt: null,
  endedAt: null,
  createdAt: Date.now(),
};
await insertExperiment(exp);
// Move it to "running" when ready to start collecting assignments.
await updateExperiment(exp.id, { status: "running" });
```

The agent loop reads active experiments via `resolveActiveExperimentConfig()` and applies the variant's `model` override automatically. Assignment uses consistent hashing — same user always gets the same variant.

Compute results with `POST /_agent-native/observability/experiments/:id/results`.

In production, experiment management routes require the caller's email in the
comma-separated `AGENT_NATIVE_EXPERIMENT_ADMIN_EMAILS` allowlist. This gate is
separate from normal app/org admin roles because an experiment affects every
user in that deployment.

### 5. Dashboard

`ObservabilityDashboard` is a React component with 5 tabs:
- **Overview** — metric cards (runs, cost, latency, tool success, thumbs up rate, eval score)
- **Conversations** — trace list with drill-down to span detail
- **Evals** — eval stats and criteria breakdown bars
- **Experiments** — experiment list with status badges, drill-down to results
- **Feedback** — feedback stream, thumbs ratio, category badges

Add a dashboard route to any template:
```tsx
// app/routes/observability.tsx
import { ObservabilityDashboard } from "@agent-native/core/client/observability";

export default function ObservabilityPage() {
  return (
    <div className="min-h-screen bg-background p-6">
      <ObservabilityDashboard />
    </div>
  );
}
```

## API Endpoints

All endpoints support `?since=N` (ms timestamp) and `?limit=N` query params.

## SQL Tables

9 tables created automatically via `ensureObservabilityTables()`:
- `agent_trace_spans` — individual trace spans
- `agent_trace_summaries` — aggregated run summaries
- `agent_feedback` — explicit user feedback
- `agent_satisfaction_scores` — computed frustration index
- `agent_evals` — evaluation results
- `agent_eval_datasets` — golden test datasets
- `agent_experiments` — experiment definitions
- `agent_experiment_assignments` — user → variant assignments
- `agent_experiment_results` — computed metric results

All tables are dialect-agnostic (SQLite + Postgres) and strictly additive.

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `packages/core/src/observability/types.ts` | Shared type definitions |
| `packages/core/src/observability/store.ts` | SQL tables + CRUD |
| `packages/core/src/observability/traces.ts` | Auto-instrumentation |
| `packages/core/src/observability/feedback.ts` | Feedback + Frustration Index |
| `packages/core/src/observability/evals.ts` | Eval engine (3 layers) |
| `packages/core/src/observability/experiments.ts` | A/B testing system |
| `packages/core/src/observability/routes.ts` | HTTP API handlers |
| `packages/core/src/client/observability/ObservabilityDashboard.tsx` | Admin dashboard |
| `packages/core/src/client/observability/ThumbsFeedback.tsx` | Inline feedback buttons |
| `packages/core/src/client/observability/useObservability.ts` | React Query hooks |

## Export to External Platforms

Configure OTLP export in the observability settings:

```ts
await putSetting("observability-config", {
  enabled: true,
  exporters: [
    {
      type: "otlp",
      endpoint: "https://cloud.langfuse.com/api/public/otel",
      headers: { Authorization: "Bearer ..." },
    },
  ],
});
```

The framework emits `gen_ai.*` semantic convention spans compatible with Langfuse, Datadog, Grafana, New Relic, and any OTel-compatible backend.

## Live OpenTelemetry Spans (Optional)

Separate from the `exporters` config above (which ships the in-house traces to an OTLP endpoint), the agent loop can also emit **live OpenTelemetry spans** for every run, model call, and tool call, so a host that already runs an OTel collector sees agent activity alongside its other distributed traces.

This layer is optional and **no-op by default**:

- `@opentelemetry/api` is an **optional dependency**. If it isn't installed, the span helpers degrade to silent no-ops — they never throw into the agent loop.
- Even with the api package installed, it ships a default no-op tracer. Spans become real only once the **host registers a `TracerProvider`** (via `@opentelemetry/sdk-node` or similar). The framework deliberately does not depend on the heavy SDK/exporter packages and never registers a provider itself — instrumentation is opt-in by the embedding app.

The loop emits `agent.run` (with `agent.run_id`, `agent.thread_id`, `agent.user_id`, `agent.model`), `tool.call` (`tool.name` + status), and `llm.call` spans, each finished with OK/ERROR status. This is purely additive to the in-house `agent_trace_spans` / `agent_trace_summaries` tables. Source: `packages/core/src/observability/tracing.ts` + `traces.ts`. See the Observability doc for the full table.

## Tracking Bridge

Instrumented agent loops also emit one server-side tracking event per completed
LLM generation:

- Event name: `$ai_generation`
- Provider path: `track()` from `@agent-native/core/tracking`, so configured
  PostHog, Agent Native Analytics, Mixpanel, Amplitude, and webhook providers
  receive it through the same best-effort fan-out as other tracking events.
- PostHog shape: uses AI Observability properties such as `$ai_trace_id`,
  `$ai_session_id`, `$ai_model`, `$ai_provider`, `$ai_input_tokens`,
  `$ai_output_tokens`, `$ai_latency`, `$ai_total_cost_usd`, and `$ai_is_error`.
- Agent Native Analytics shape: the same event lands in `analytics_events` with
  mirrored query-friendly properties such as `run_id`, `thread_id`,
  `cost_cents_x100`, `duration_ms`, `tool_calls`, `successful_tools`,
  `failed_tools`, and `status`. A content-free `tools` array includes at most
  50 tool names, start offsets, durations, statuses, and coarse error classes;
  interrupted calls are finalized as errors, and failed runs still emit with
  zero or known usage. `tools_truncated` marks longer runs while the rollup counts remain complete.
  Delegated runs add `delegation_protocol`, `caller_app`, `a2a_task_id`, and
  `parent_run_id` when available. `parent_turn_id` is separate because one
  logical turn may span multiple concrete runs.

Do not build a separate LLM-observability ingestion API unless there is a clear
reason the tracking provider registry cannot express the use case. Keep prompt,
tool input, and model output content out of tracking by default; use the existing
observability config flags for local trace content capture.
